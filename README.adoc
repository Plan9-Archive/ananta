= {name}: one hell of an operating system
:docpath: ./sys/doc/manual
:name: inf

link:{docpath}/intro.adoc[{name}] is a derivative of http://www.inferno-os.info/inferno/[Inferno] (a distributed operating system originally developed at http://www.bell-labs.com/[Bell Labs] and currently maintained by http://www.vitanuova.com/[Vita Nuova]) aimed at modernization for mass adoption.

WARNING: {name} is not ready for production use.

Applications are written in link:{docpath}/limbo.adoc[limbo] and compiled for link:{docpath}/dis.adoc[dis] to run anywhere on a network in a portable operating system.

The design has three principles:

 .  All resources are named and accessed as files.
 .  One protocol (link:{docpath}/9p.adoc[9p]) allows uniform access to these resources.
 .  A single local namespace joins resources provided by remote services.

In this manner, programs can access resources using only the file operations `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`.

NOTE: That is to say, networked participants only need to communicate with 9p instead of http(s)/dav, smtp, imap/pop, ssh/scp, ftp, ssl/tls, smb, ntp, ppp, ldap, dhcp, dns, sip, ...


The following system/architecture pairs are supported:

//Dependencies:

//32bit: gcc, x11, x

To install

 . edit link:mkconfig[`mkconfig`]
 . execute link:makemk.sh[`makemk.sh`] to build link:{docpath}/mk.adoc[`mk`].
 . set `PATH` to include the `$ROOT/arch/$OBJTYPE/$SYSTARG/bin/` directory.
 . run `mk install`

This will create and install the libraries, limbo compiler, emu (if running hosted), and auxiliary commands.

Now execute `emu` and you should see the link:{docpath}/sh.adoc[`sh`] prompt awaiting your input:

    ;

Documentation is at link:{docpath}[].
