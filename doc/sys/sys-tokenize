SYS-TOKENIZE(2)          System Calls Manual         SYS-TOKENIZE(2)

NAME
       tokenize - split string into words

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       tokenize: fn(s, delim: string): (int, list of string);

DESCRIPTION
       Tokenize  breaks  s  into  words  separated  by characters in
       delim.  The returned tuple holds the number of words  and  an
       ordered list of those words (whose hd gives the leftmost word
       from s).

       Words are delimited by the maximal sequences of any character
       from  the  delim string.  Tokenize skips delimiter characters
       at the beginning and  end  of  s,  so  each  element  in  the
       returned list has non-zero length.

       If s is nil or contains no words, tokenize returns a count of
       zero and a nil list.

       Delim may be nil or the empty string, specifying no delimiter
       characters.  The resulting word list will be nil (if s is nil
       or the empty string) or a single-item list with a copy of s.
