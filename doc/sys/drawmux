DRAWMUX(2)               System Calls Manual              DRAWMUX(2)

NAME
       drawmux - multiplex stream of draw requests

SYNOPSIS
       include "drawmux.m";
       drawmux := load Drawmux Drawmux->PATH;

       init:         fn(): (string, ref Draw->Display);
       newviewer:  fn(fd: ref Sys->FD);

DESCRIPTION
       Drawmux  puts  itself  between  the  invoking application and
       /dev/draw (see draw(3)), so that the contents of the  current
       display can be replicated elsewhere.

       Init returns a new Display (see draw-display(2)) representing
       a connection to a virtual display  device.   Subsequent  Draw
       requests to that display (see draw-intro(2)) are forwarded to
       the underlying draw(3) device to appear on the physical  dis‐
       play,  but can also replicated elsewhere, typically in a win‐
       dow on a remote display.

       Newviewer prepares the virtual display end of a Drawmux  con‐
       nection  for each new viewer of the display created by a pre‐
       vious call to init.  The file descriptor fd is  a  connection
       to  the  viewer.  The remote viewer must first write 24 bytes
       on that connection, containing two decimal numbers  (each  11
       digits and a space), giving the identifier of a public screen
       on the viewer's display, on which  newviewer  will  replicate
       the  Drawmux  display,  and the log (base 2) of the number of
       bits per pixel for  windows  created  on  that  screen.   The
       remote  viewer  must then use Sys->export (see sys-export(2))
       to export its /dev/draw, which newviewer expects to  find  as
       the  root  of the exported hierarchy.  Subsequent draw opera‐
       tions on the Drawmux display will be replicated on the public
       screen  exported by the viewer.  Shutting down the connection
       shuts down the multiplexor for that viewer.
