SYS-UTFBYTES(2)          System Calls Manual         SYS-UTFBYTES(2)

NAME
       utfbytes  - compute UTF length of complete Unicode characters
       in a UTF byte sequence

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       utfbytes: fn(buf: array of byte, n: int): int;

DESCRIPTION
       Utfbytes examines the n-byte UTF sequence in buf and  returns
       the number of bytes representing complete Unicode characters.
       The value will be less than n when the region inspected  ends
       with an incomplete UTF sequence.

DIAGNOSTIC
       A  bounds  check error results if n exceeds the length of the
       array.
