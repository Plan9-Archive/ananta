NAME
       sleep - delay

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       sleep:    fn(period: int): int;

DESCRIPTION
       Sleep  suspends  the  current thread for period milliseconds.
       The actual suspension time may be a little more or less  than
       the requested time.  If period is 0, the process gives up the
       CPU if another process is waiting to run,  returning  immedi‚Äê
       ately if not.

       Sleep  normally returns 0. In hosted Inferno it may return -1
       to indicate that it was not possible to sleep (eg if no  more
       threads are available).
