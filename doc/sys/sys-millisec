SYS-MILLISEC(2)          System Calls Manual         SYS-MILLISEC(2)

NAME
       millisec - millisecond timer

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       millisec: fn(): int;

DESCRIPTION
       Millisec  returns  the  value of an internal system clock, in
       milliseconds.  The actual resolution of the clock is a  prop‐
       erty  of the underlying system and may be coarser than a mil‐
       lisecond.  The epoch is arbitrary, so millisec is useful  for
       measuring  durations  but  not  absolute time.  If the system
       operates  continuously,  the  millisecond  counter  overflows
       every few months; a reboot resets the epoch.
