DRAW-POINTER(2)          System Calls Manual         DRAW-POINTER(2)

NAME
       Pointer - state of a pointer device such as a mouse

SYNOPSIS
       include   "draw.m";
       draw := load Draw Draw->PATH;

       Pointer: adt
       {
           buttons:  int;
           xy:       Point;
       };

DESCRIPTION
       buttons   Each  button  on the device corresponds to a bit in
                 buttons; zero bits indicate released (or  non-exis‐
                 tent),  and  one  bits indicate pressed.  The bits,
                 from least to most significant positions, represent
                 the buttons from left to right.

       xy        The pointer's screen coordinates.

       Mux(1)  uses the cptr member of the Draw->Context adt to pass
       pointer events through to applications.
