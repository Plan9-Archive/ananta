FILEPAT(2)               System Calls Manual              FILEPAT(2)

NAME
       filepat: expand, match - file pattern matching

SYNOPSIS
       include "filepat.m";
       filepat := load Filepat Filepat->PATH;

       expand:  fn(pat: string): list of string;
       match:   fn(pat, name: string): int;

DESCRIPTION
       Expand builds a list of file names in alphabetical order that
       match the pattern pat.  The pattern is tokenised using / as a
       delimiter.

       Match returns 1 if name matches the pattern pat, and 0 other‐
       wise.

       The pat passed to match and expand may  include  combinations
       of the special characters *, ?, [, and ].

       The asterisk * matches a string of zero or more characters.

       The query ?  matches any single character.

       The  notation  [s], where s is a nonempty string, matches any
       single character in s.  The  notation  [^s],  where  s  is  a
       nonempty  string, matches any single character not in s.  The
       characters *, ?, and [ have no special meaning within s.

       If any character is preceded by the character \, that charac‐
       ter loses any special meaning and is interpreted literally.
