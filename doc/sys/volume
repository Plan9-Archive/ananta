VOLUME(2)                System Calls Manual               VOLUME(2)

NAME
       volume - volume control for an infrared interface

SYNOPSIS
       include "volume.m";
       vctl := load Volumectl Volumectl->PATH;

       volumectl: fn(ctxt: ref Draw->Context, ch: chan of int,
                      device: string);

DESCRIPTION
       Volumectl  should  be  spawned as a separate process from any
       process that desires volume control via  an  infrared  inter‚Äê
       face.  Ctxt provides volumectl with access to the display, on
       which it displays a slider widget.  The slider  automatically
       disappears  after  several  seconds of inactivity.  Volumectl
       receives input from the infrared controller  on  channel  ch.
       The values recognized are:

       VolUP  increase volume

       VolDN  decrease volume

       Enter  exit

       Device  is  a  string  used  as  a  prefix to commands to the
       device; for example "audio out" for audio(3).
