SYS-WERRSTR(2)           System Calls Manual          SYS-WERRSTR(2)

NAME
       werrstr - set the system error string

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       werrstr(s: string): int;

DESCRIPTION
       When  a  system  call fails, it returns an error value (often
       -1) and records a string  describing  the  error  in  a  per-
       process  location.   The  verb  r in sys-print(2) outputs the
       error string.  Werrstr sets the process's error string to  s,
       to  allow a function in a module to mimic the error reporting
       interface of a system call.
