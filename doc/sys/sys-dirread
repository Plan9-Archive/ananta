SYS-DIRREAD(2)           System Calls Manual          SYS-DIRREAD(2)

NAME
       dirread - read directory

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       dirread:  fn(fd: ref FD): (int, array of Dir);

DESCRIPTION
       Dirread reads the contents of the directory pointed to by the
       open file descriptor fd,  returning  a  tuple  containing  an
       array  with  one Dir structure for each directory entry read.
       These Dir structures are equivalent to the result of  a  stat
       call  on  each  file in the directory.  See sys-stat(2) for a
       description of stat and Dir.

       A successful dirread returns a tuple  giving  the  number  of
       entries  read  and  the resulting array.  A return of (0,nil)
       indicates the end of the directory.   Directory  entries  are
       variable  length  in  general; the file offset is advanced by
       the number of bytes actually read.

       Seeks (see sys-seek(2)) are allowed on  directories  only  to
       seek to the start.

       In  general,  several calls to dirread will be needed to read
       the whole directory.  Readdir  (2)  provides  functions  that
       return all the directory entries at once, optionally sorted.

SEE ALSO
       readdir(2),   sys-intro(2),  sys-open(2),  sys-read(2),  sys-
       seek(2), sys-stat(2)

DIAGNOSTICS
       The integer in dirread's return tuple has a value  of  -1  on
       error,  and 0 on end of file.  The array element of the tuple
       is nil in both cases.
