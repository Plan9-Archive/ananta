STYXCONV(2)              System Calls Manual             STYXCONV(2)

NAME
       styxconv  -  convert  between  old 1995 Styx and current Styx
       (9P)

SYNOPSIS
       include "styxconv.m";
       styxconv := load Styxconv Styxconv->PATHNEW2OLD;
       styxconv := load Styxconv Styxconv->PATHOLD2NEW;

       init:     fn();
       styxconv: fn(client: ref Sys->FD, server: ref Sys->FD);

DESCRIPTION
       Styxconv converts between the obsolete 1995  version  of  the
       Styx  protocol,  as used for instance in Inferno's Third Edi‐
       tion and earlier, and the current file service protocol, pre‐
       viously also called `Styx' but based on 9P2000 and defined by
       intro(5).

       Init must be called before any other function in the module.

       The function styxconv  takes  two  file  descriptors:  client
       should  be  a connection to a client requiring one version of
       the protocol; server should be a connection to a server serv‐
       ing the other version of the protocol.  There are two conver‐
       sion modules: PATHNEW2OLD converts from a new  client  to  an
       old  server; PATHOLD2NEW converts from an old client to a new
       server.

       Styxconv should be spawned by the caller, and copies messages
       between  client  and server, converting as required.  See the
       example below.

EXAMPLE
       Apply styxconv to file descriptor fd,  connected  to  an  old
       Styx server, and return a file descriptor suitable for mount‐
       ing with mount(2).

              cvstyx(fd: ref Sys->FD): ref Sys->FD
              {
                   styxconv := load Styxconv Styxconv->NEW2OLDPATH;
                   if(styxconv == nil)
                        return nil;
                   p := array[2] of ref Sys->FD;
                   if(sys->pipe(p) < 0)
                        return nil;
                   styxconv->init();
                   spawn styxconv->styxconv(p[1], fd);
                   return p[0];
              }
