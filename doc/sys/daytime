DESCRIPTION
       These routines perform time conversions relative to the epoch
       00:00:00  GMT,  Jan.  1,  1970.  Note the range of values for
       each member of the Tm adt.  The conventions are the  same  as
       those of C's ctime.

       Text converts a time structure referenced by tm from local or
       GMT time to a string in the format:

              Sat Jan  1 13:00:00 GMT 2000

       Filet converts the file access or modification  time  t  from
       seconds since the epoch to local time as a string in the for‚Äê
       mat:

              Jan  1 13:00

       if the file is less than 6 months old or

              Jan  1 2000

       if the file is older than 6 months, compared to the time now.

       Gmt converts seconds since the epoch, received in tim,  to  a
       time structure in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

       Local converts seconds since the epoch, received in tim, to a
       time structure in local time.

       Now returns the time in seconds since the epoch, obtained  by
       reading /dev/time (see cons(3)).

       Time  converts seconds since the epoch to the local time as a
       string in the format Fri May 19 17:01:36 BST 2000.

       Tm2epoch converts a time  structure  referenced  by  tm  from
       local or GMT time to seconds since the epoch.

       String2tm  returns a reference to a Tm value corresponding to
       the date and time in textual form in  string  s,  which  must
       have one of the forms below:

              Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT    (RFC822, RFC1123)
              Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT   (RFC850)
              Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 GMT 1994     (output of text, above)

       A  missing  time  zone  in  any  format is assumed to be GMT.
       String2tm returns nil if s is not correctly formed.

       When local time is first requested, daytime reads a table for
       time  zone conversion from the timezone environment variable,
       if that is set, and otherwise from the file /locale/timezone,
       which  is  copied from one of the other files in /locale when
       the system is installed.  The timezone table is a  text  file
       containing  lines  of space-separated fields.  The first line
       gives the normal time zone name and its difference  from  GMT
       in seconds followed by an alternative time zone name (eg, for
       `daylight savings' or `summer' time) and its difference  from
       GMT  followed by a newline.  The remainder is a list of pairs
       of times (seconds past the start of 1970, in the  first  time
       zone) when the alternative time zone applies.  For example:

              EST -18000 EDT -14400
               9943200 25664400 41392800 57718800 ...

       Greenwich Mean Time is represented by

              GMT 0

BUGS
       The  sign  bit of a Limbo integer holding a time will turn on
       68 years from the epoch.
