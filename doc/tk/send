SEND(9)               Kernel Developer's Manual              SEND(9)

NAME
       send - send a value down a Tk channel

SYNOPSIS
       send chan string

DESCRIPTION
       Send  is  the gateway from the Tk world into the Limbo world.
       It sends string down chan, which should previously have  been
       named  with  a call to namechan (see tk(2)).  Tk channels are
       non blocking, so the call will  return  immediately,  whether
       the  message  has been sent or not. If too many messages have
       been queued on the chan, then the message will be  discarded,
       and  a warning printed on the console.  String is not subject
       to interpretation by the usual Tk quoting rules.

BUGS
       String is not subject to interpretation by the usual Tk quot‐
       ing rules.  This means, for example that:
            radiobutton .x -text X -variable x -value x
            radiobutton .y -text Y -variable y -value y
            button .z -text Submit {send chan submit [variable X]}
       will not work as expected. Instead, one must interrogate val‐
       ues directly in Limbo.

       The specialised queued channels will be replaced by  buffered
       channels in Limbo in a future edition of Inferno.
