PANEL(9)              Kernel Developer's Manual             PANEL(9)

NAME
       panel - embedded graphics

SYNOPSIS
       panel pathName ?options?

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -anchor       -borderwidth  -background   -relief

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       -height dist
              Specifies  a  desired  height  for the panel.  If this
              option isn't specified, the panel's desired height  is
              computed  from the image and mask images. If these are
              replicated, the default is zero.

       -width dist
              Specifies a desired width  for  the  panel.   If  this
              option  isn't specified, the panel's desired height is
              computed from the image and mask images. If these  are
              replicated, the default is zero.

DESCRIPTION
       The panel command creates a new window (given by the pathName
       argument) and makes  it  into  a  panel  widget.   Additional
       options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command
       line to configure aspects of the panel such as its background
       colour  and  3-D relief.  The panel command returns its path‐
       Name argument.  At the time this command  is  invoked,  there
       must not exist a window named pathName.

       A  panel  is  a widget that displays arbitrary graphics drawn
       outside of Tk. An application is free to  use  any  image  or
       mask  that  it  chooses to create; the panel will display the
       contents of the image through the mask (see draw(2)).

       A panel widget will not display anything until its image  has
       been set using putimage (see tk(2)).

WIDGET COMMAND
       The  panel  command  creates  a  new Tk command whose name is
       pathName. This command may be used to invoke  various  opera‐
       tions on the widget: It has the following general form:
              pathName option ?arg arg ...?
       Option and the args determine the exact behaviour of the com‐
       mand.  The following commands are possible for panel widgets:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration  option
              given  by  option.   Option may have any of the values
              accepted by the panel function.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the  wid‐
              get.  If no option is specified, returns a list of all
              of the available options for pathName.  If one or more
              option-value  pairs  are  specified,  then the command
              modifies the given widget option(s) to have the  given
              value(s);   in  this case the command returns an empty
              string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by
              the panel function

       pathName dirty ?minx miny maxx maxy?
              Mark  the  area  inside  the  given  rectangle ((minx,
              miny), (maxx, maxy)) to be flushed to the  screen.  If
              the  rectangle  is  not  given, the whole area will be
              marked.  The coordinates are relative to  the  image's
              origin.

       pathName origin ?x y?
              Set  the point within the image that will be displayed
              at the top left of the panel's rectangle.  If the area
              allocated  to the panel is more than the area drawn by
              the image,  the  ``top  left''  will  positioned  with
              respect  to  the  value of the -anchor option.  If the
              point is not given, the current origin is returned.

       pathName panelx ?screenx?
              Given a screen  x-coordinate,  screenx,  this  command
              returns the image x-coordinate displayed at that loca‐
              tion.

       pathName panely ?screeny?
              Given a screen  y-coordinate,  screeny,  this  command
              returns the image y-coordinate displayed at that loca‐
              tion.

       pathName screenx ?panelx?
              Given an  image  x-coordinate,  panelx,  this  command
              returns the equivalent screen x-coordinate.

       pathName screeny ?panely?
              Given  an  image  y-coordinate,  panely,  this command
              returns the equivalent screen y-coordinate.

BINDINGS
       When a new panel is created, it has no  default  event  bind‐
       ings.
