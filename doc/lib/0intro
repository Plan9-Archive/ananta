NAME
       intro - introduction to the Inferno devices

DESCRIPTION
       An  Inferno  device  implements  a  file tree for client pro‐
       cesses.  A file name beginning with a hash  (number)  symbol,
       such  as  names the root of a file tree implemented by a par‐
       ticular kernel device  driver  identified  by  the  character
       after the hash.  Such names are usually bound to conventional
       locations in the name space.  For example, after

              sys->bind("#c", "/dev", sys->MREPL)

       an ls(1) of /dev will list the files provided by the  console
       device.

       A  kernel  device  driver  is  a  server  in the sense of the
       Inferno File Protocol, 9P (see Section 5), but with the  mes‐
       sages  implemented  by  local  rather  than  remote procedure
       calls.  Also, several of the messages (Nop, Flush, and Error)
       have no subroutine equivalents.

       When  a  system  call is passed a file name beginning with it
       looks at the next character, and if that is  a  valid  device
       character  it  performs  an  attach(5)  on  the corresponding
       device to  get  a  channel  representing  the  root  of  that
       device's  file  tree.   If there are any characters after the
       device character but before the next or end of string,  those
       characters are passed as parameter aname to the attach.

       Each  kernel  device  has a conventional place at which to be
       bound to the name space.  The SYNOPSIS sections of  the  fol‐
       lowing  pages includes a shell bind command to put the device
       in the conventional place.  Most  of  these  binds  are  done
       automatically by the system when it initializes; see init(8).
