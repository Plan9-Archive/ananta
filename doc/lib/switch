NAME
       switch - hardware option switch

SYNOPSYS
       bind -a '#r' /dev

       /dev/switch

DESCRIPTION
       The switch device serves a one-level directory, giving access
       to one read-only file, switch.  A read returns the  value  of
       the development board's option switch (DS1), represented as a
       decimal number from 0 to 15,  representing  four  bits,  each
       corresponding  to  one of the four toggles.  Each toggle pro‐
       duces the value 0 when it is set `ON' and 1 when it  is  off.
       Toggle 1 corresponds to bit 1<<3 in the number, toggle 2 cor‐
       responds to bit 1<<2, and so on
