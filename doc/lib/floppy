DESCRIPTION
       The floppy disk interface serves a one-level directory giving
       access to up to four floppy disk drives.  Each drive is  rep‐
       resented  by  a  data  and control file.  There are no parti‐
       tions.

       Messages accepted by the ctl file include:

       eject  Eject the floppy, if possible.

       reset  Reset the drive.

       format type
              Format the floppy.  The type sets the density and type
              of disk to be formatted; see format(8).

       A  read  of the ctl file returns a string describing the form
       factor of the disk, one of 3½DD, 3½HD, 5¼DD, or 5¼HD.
