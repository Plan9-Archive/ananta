SRV9(3)               Library Functions Manual               SRV9(3)

NAME
       srv9 - plan 9 server registry

SYNOPSIS
       bind -c #₪ /srv

       /srv/service1
       /srv/service2
        ...

DESCRIPTION
       On  Inferno  hosted on Plan 9, srv9 serves a one-level direc‐
       tory that gives Inferno applications direct access to Plan  9
       services posted in its #s server registry, and allows Inferno
       applications to post services for access by Plan  9  applica‐
       tions.   A  service is represented by a file descriptor, usu‐
       ally serving the common file service  protocol  described  in
       intro(5),  allowing  it  to  be mounted (see bind(1) and sys-
       bind(2)) in the name space of an  application  in  the  other
       system.

       To  access a Plan 9 service in Inferno, open the desired ser‐
       vice file; the resulting file descriptor is connected to  the
       associated  Plan  9  service.   When that service is a shared
       Plan 9 file  service,  srv9  automatically  starts  Plan  9's
       exportfs  with appropriate options to make the service acces‐
       sible from Inferno.  It can safely  be  shared  with  Plan  9
       applications,  but  note that any path names mentioned in the
       attach specifier (see mount(1) and attach(5)) will be in  the
       Plan  9  application's  name  space, not the Inferno applica‐
       tion's.  (Indeed, a similar caveat applies in Plan 9 itself.)

       To export an Inferno service to Plan 9,  create  a  new  file
       such  as  /srv/myserv  using Sys->create with mode Sys->ORDWR
       (see sys-open(2)) and any desired  permissions  for  the  new
       service  file.  (Note that the #₪ device must have been bound
       in with the -c option, as shown above,  to  allow  file  cre‐
       ation.)   If  the create is successful, Plan 9's service reg‐
       istry will have a new entry myserv, and the  file  descriptor
       returned from create acts as a pipe to any Plan 9 application
       that opens the associated service file in Plan 9.   Typically
       on  the  Inferno  side  the file descriptor is passed to sys-
       export(2) or made the standard input of an Inferno file  ser‐
       vice  (see  intro(4)).   The Plan 9 service file is automati‐
       cally removed when the Inferno file descriptor is  no  longer
       referenced.

EXAMPLES
       To make Plan 9's factotum available in Inferno:

              mount -Aa /srv/factotum /mnt

       (Note the -A option to suppress Inferno authentication.)

       To  mount the Plan 9 file service from which a Plan 9 machine
       booted:

              mount -9 /srv/boot /n/local

       The -9 option to mount(1)  requests  Plan  9  authentication;
       that  could also have been used instead of -A in the previous
       example.

       To make the environment variables of the current Inferno name
       space available to Plan 9:

              fd := sys->create("/srv/infenv", Sys->ORDWR, 8r600);
              sys->export(fd, "/env", Sys->EXPWAIT);
