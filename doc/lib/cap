CAP(3)                Library Functions Manual                CAP(3)

NAME
       cap - capability for changing user name

SYNOPSIS
       bind #Â¤ dir

       dir/caphash
       dir/capuse

DESCRIPTION
       Cap  allows a process owned by the host owner (see eve(10.2))
       to give another process on the same machine a  capability  to
       set  its  user name to a specified user.  The capability is a
       string of the form:

              [ fromuser@ ] touser@key

       where fromuser is a process's current user  name,  touser  is
       its  new  user name, and key is a string of random characters
       (eg, produced by security-random(2)).

       Caphash is a write-only file that can only be opened  by  the
       host  owner.   A  process  enables the use of a capability by
       writing the keyed hash of fromuser@touser  to  caphash.   The
       hash is computed using Keyring->hmac_sha1 as follows:

              kr := load Keyring Keyring->PATH;
              IPint: import kr;
              users := sys->sprint("%s@%s", fromuser, touser);
              cap := sys->sprint("%s@%s", users, key);
              digest := array[Keyring->SHA1dlen] of byte;
              ausers := array of byte users;
              kr->hmac_sha1(ausers, len ausers, array of byte key, digest, nil);
              if(sys->write(caphashfd, digest, len digest) < 0)
                   error();

       The capability (eg, cap in the example) can then be passed to
       another process.

       Capuse is a  write-only  file  that  can  be  opened  by  any
       process.  It can then write a capability string to change its
       user name,  provided  that  capability  has  previously  been
       enabled  by the host owner via caphash, and if the capability
       included a fromuser, the writing process currently  has  that
       user  name.   After  a  successful write, the writing process
       will be owned by touser.  Any capability can be used at  most
       once.

       A  capability  enabled  by caphash has a limited lifetime, on
       the order of 30 seconds.  Caphash can be removed by the  host
       owner to prevent its further use.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A  write  to  capuse without a previous write to caphash sets
       the error string to ``invalid capability''.
