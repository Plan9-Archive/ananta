RTC(3)                Library Functions Manual                RTC(3)

NAME
       rtc - real-time clock and non-volatile memory

SYNOPSIS
       bind -b '#r' /dev

       /dev/rtc
       /dev/rtcid
       /dev/nvram

DESCRIPTION
       The rtc device provides access to the real-time clock and any
       associated non-volatile memory.  Physical  devices  supported
       include  the Mostek MK48T12-15 Zeropower/Timekeeper, the Dal‐
       las Semiconductor DS1687 real-time  clock,  and  the  IBM  PC
       real-time clock on various platforms.

       The  rtc file when read returns the time as a decimal number,
       expressed as the number of seconds since the epoch, 1 January
       1970 00:00 GMT.  The clock is set by writing the desired num‐
       ber of seconds since the epoch to the file.  Setting the time
       in  this  device  has  no  effect  on system time returned by
       /dev/time (see cons(3)), which  must  be  set  separately  if
       desired.   For  example,  when  rtc  is available osinit (see
       init(8)) uses it to set /dev/time.

       The nvram file provides access  to  the  non-volatile  memory
       commonly  implemented  by  these  clock  chips.  There are no
       cross-platform standards for the range of addresses that  can
       be  safely  used by Inferno, or for the content and format of
       the data.

       The rtcid file holds a decimal number giving the serial  num‐
       ber of the device, set during manufacturing.  The file exists
       only if a particular device provides such a number.

BUGS
       The rtc file returns seconds but /dev/time returns  microsec‐
       onds: it's history.
