LOGFILE(4)            Kernel Interfaces Manual            LOGFILE(4)

NAME
       logfile - memory-based append-only circular storage buffer

SYNOPSIS
       logfile [-size] file

DESCRIPTION
       Logfile creates a name at file (the containing directory must
       already exist).  Each write to file appends the written  data
       up  to  a  maximum of size bytes; subsequent writes erase the
       existing data in a circular fashion. A read  from  file  will
       return  any  currently stored data, if any; if there is none,
       then it will block until more data becomes available.  Multi‚Äê
       ple  readers  will  receive  the  data  independently  of one
       another. If a writing process is consistently producing  data
       faster  than  a reading process, then the data read will have
       some bytes elided; a write is never blocked.

BUGS
       Restrictions  on  sys-file2chan(2)  mean  that  the   logfile
       process  will  not  terminate  automatically when its file is
       removed or unmounted.

       There is no indication to a reader of any missing data.

       It is not possible to do a non-blocking read of the log file.
