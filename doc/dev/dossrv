NAME
       dossrv, 9660srv - DOS/Windows and ISO 9660 file systems

SYNOPSIS
       dossrv  [-v] [-s] [-F] [-c] [ -f devicefile ] [ -m mountpoint
       ] [ -S sectors/track ]

       9660srv [-rab] cdfile dir

DESCRIPTION
       Dossrv makes the contents of a DOS/Windows file system  visi‐
       ble in the Inferno name space.  The options are:

       -v     print  a  debugging  trace,  including 9P messages, on
              standard error

       -F     display FAT information

       -c     display cluster data and I/O activity

       -s     standard ouput is connected to a client; serve that

       -f devicefile
              the  DOS/Windows  file  system  image;   defaults   to
              /dev/hd0disk.

       -m mountpoint
              The  directory  where  the contents of the file system
              should appear; defaults to /n/dos.

       -S sectors/track
              The number of sectors per track. The default is 9.

       9660srv  performs  a  similar  function  for  files  (notably
       CDROMs) in ISO9660 format, including the Rock Ridge extension
       and its Plan 9 variant.  It makes the contents of cdfile vis‐
       ible  in  the  name  space  at dir.  The options are those of
       bind(1): -r, to replace the contents of dir; -a,  to  make  a
       union  directory  with  the CD contents after the contents of
       dir; -b, to make a  union  directory  with  the  CD  contents
       before the contents of dir.
