IMPORT(4)             Kernel Interfaces Manual             IMPORT(4)

NAME
       import, 9export - exchange name spaces with a Plan 9 system

SYNOPSIS
       import  [  -ab ] [ -c ] [ -k keyspec ] [ -e crypt hash ] host
       file [ localfile ]

       9export [ -A ] [ -k keyspec ] [ -e crypt hash ]

DESCRIPTION
       Import dials the Plan 9 host  (which  might  be  the  current
       host)  and makes the given file on that system visible in the
       local name space as localfile (if  localfile  is  not  given,
       file  is  used  as the local name).  The authentication agent
       factotum(4) must be active.  (When Inferno is running on Plan
       9,  Plan 9's own authentication agent can be used, by binding
       Plan 9's /mnt/factotum to the same name in Inferno's own name
       space.  See  fs(3).)   The remote files are accessed with the
       permissions of the user authenticated to the remote system by
       factotum.

       If the remote file is a directory, the whole file tree rooted
       at that directory is accessible, the local mount  point  must
       also  be  a directory, and the -a, -b, and -c options control
       the creation of union directories just as  for  bind(1).   By
       default,  the  remote file replaces the local one in the name
       space.

       If the -e option is given,  the  network  connection  can  be
       encrypted,  or provided with digests to authenticate the con‐
       tents, or both.  Crypt is an encryption algorithm accepted by
       ssl(3);  hash  is  one  of  its  digest algorithms.  Plan 9's
       exportfs normally requires 'rc4_256  sha1'  on  such  connec‐
       tions; it currently provides no negotiation of algorithms.

       The  -k  option  gives a string of space separated attr=value
       pairs that control factotum's selection of a suitable key for
       the remote system.

       9export  serves  the Plan 9 exportfs protocol on its standard
       input, allowing a Plan  9  system  to  import  parts  of  the
       Inferno name space in which 9export is run.  If the -A option
       is given, the caller is not  authenticated,  line  encryption
       and  message  authentication  are  not  done,  and the Plan 9
       exportfs protocol starts immediately.  Otherwise, factotum(4)
       must be accessible via /mnt/factotum as for import, and it is
       used to run the Plan 9 authentication protocol.  The  -e  and
       -k  options are as for import.  Normally 9export returns when
       the client  closes  the  connection;  the  -a  option  causes
       9export  to  return  immediately, leaving a kernel process to
       serve the name space.  9export might be used as follows:

              listen -Av 'tcp!*!exportfs' {9export&}

       Beware that currently the name space is served with the  per‐
       missions  of  the  person  running  9export, not those of the
       caller.
