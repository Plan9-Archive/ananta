TARFS(4)              Kernel Interfaces Manual              TARFS(4)

NAME
       tarfs - mount tar archive

SYNOPSIS
       tarfs [ -ab ] [ -p ] tarfile mountpt

DESCRIPTION
       Tarfs  makes  the  contents  of  the  directories  and  files
       archived in the given Unix/POSIX tar archive tarfile  visible
       in  the  name space under mountpt.  They can then be accessed
       in an obvious way by other commands such as ls(1) and  cp(1).
       Only  read  access  is  supported.   User and group names are
       taken from the ``ustar'' headers  when  present.   Otherwise,
       the  numeric  user  and  group  IDs  are used.  The -a and -b
       options cause the tarfile's name space to be placed after  or
       before  the  current  contents  of mountpt; the default is to
       replace that directory's contents.  Option -p causes  permis‚Äê
       sions in the tar file to be discarded.
