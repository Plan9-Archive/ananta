GRID-CPU(4)           Kernel Interfaces Manual           GRID-CPU(4)

NAME
       grid: cpu - cpu server resource

SYNOPSIS
       grid/srv/cpu
       grid/runcpu

DESCRIPTION
       Cpu  is  a  file  server that provides a processing resource.
       This resource imports a namespace from one or  more  external
       sources  and  executes selected commands within it.  Cpu cre‐
       ates its own namespace containing three files ctl, cmd and ns
       which are used to configure the processing task prior to exe‐
       cution, this namespace is exported and served on  stdin.   In
       order  to  configure  a  processing task, a client must first
       mount the cpu namespace. Once this is done, reading  the  cmd
       and  ns  files will display the current configuration of com‐
       mands to be executed or directories to  be  imported  respec‐
       tively. The ctl file is used to modify the current configura‐
       tion and accepts the following input:

              add cmd command

              add ns path address

              del [cmd|ns] index

       Where command is the name (including full  path  and  parame‐
       ters)  of  a  command  to be executed.  Path is the name of a
       directory to import from the exported namespace available  at
       address and index is the index (as shown when reading the cmd
       and ns files) of the command or directory to be removed  from
       the configuration.

       For  example, to import /dis and /dev from a resource export‐
       ing   a   9P   (see   intro(5))    namespace    at    address
       tcp!200.1.5.53!7003  and then run ls -l and du, the following
       commands would be used:

              echo 'add cmd /dis/ls -l' > ctl
              echo 'add cmd /dis/du' > ctl
              echo 'add ns /dis tcp!200.1.5.53!7003' > ctl
              echo 'add ns /dev tcp!200.1.5.53!7003' > ctl

       Reading the cmd and ns files will give the following output:

              cmd
              1: /dis/ls -l
              2: /dis/du

              ns
              1: /dis (200.1.5.53!7003)
              2: /dev (200.1.5.53!7003)

       Once the client disconnects  from  (unmounts)  the  cpu,  the
       selected  namespaces  will  be imported and the commands exe‐
       cuted. Note: A cpu does not have any namespace  of  its  own.
       All  required  namespaces must be imported, for a simple com‐
       mand such as ls, the minimum recommended namespace to  import
       would be: /chan /dev /dis /module

       Register(1)  may  be used in conjunction with cpu to register
       it with a registry(4) and to export and serve  its  namespace
       across  dial(2) network connections. Incoming connections may
       also be displayed visually using grid-monitor(1).  For  exam‐
       ple:

       grid/register   [   options   ...   ]   {  grid/srv/cpu  }  |
       grid/srv/monitor 2 'CPU resource'

       This set of commands is encapsulated within the shell  script
       runcpu  which  will  automatically  register  cpu with a reg‐
       istry(4) if possible and start up the  graphical  display  to
       show  connections  to  the resource. There is no need for the
       user to execute cpu outside of runcpu unless the namespace it
       provides  is  required to be accessible in a different way to
       that provided by grid-register(1).

BUGS
       At the moment, Cpu will  only  import  namespaces  across  an
       unauthenticated connection as provided by ns(1).
