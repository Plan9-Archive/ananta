NAME
       palmsrv - packet link to Palm device on serial connection

SYNOPSIS
       palm/palmsrv [ -D ] [ -d device ] [ -s speed ]

DESCRIPTION
       Palmsrv  serves packet link connections to a Palm device con‐
       nected on the given device (default: /dev/eia0) at the  given
       speed   (default:  57600  baud).   Client  applications  open
       /chan/palmsrv to obtain a connection.  Each write  must  con‐
       tain the data portion of a single Packet Assembly-Disassembly
       Protocol message containing a Desklink protocol request.   If
       the  device rejects the request, the write returns a diagnos‐
       tic; otherwise, a subsequent read will retrieve the reply.

       The server can be shut down by writing the text exit  to  the
       file /chan/palmsrv:

              echo -n exit >/chan/palmsrv
