INTRO(4)              Kernel Interfaces Manual              INTRO(4)

NAME
       intro - introduction to file servers

DESCRIPTION
       This section describes programs that serve 9P (see intro(5)),
       and can therefore be mounted, generating a new  part  of  the
       name  space.  Some, such as dossrv, thereby make the contents
       of a foreign file format visible directly to Inferno applica‚Äê
       tions;  others,  such  as  acme,  provide  their own services
       through operations on files in a name space.

                                                            INTRO(4)
