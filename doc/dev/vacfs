VACFS(4)              Kernel Interfaces Manual              VACFS(4)

NAME
       vacfs - mount venti archive

SYNOPSIS
       vacfs [ -Ddp ] [ -a addr ] [vac:score]

DESCRIPTION
       Vacfs  makes  the  contents of a venti archive available over
       styx.  Standard input is used for reading  and  writing  styx
       messages.   If  score is not specified, vacfs serves multiple
       venti archives.  In this case the  root  directory  lists  no
       files,  but  walking to a directory score opens the venti ar‚Äê
       chive with that score.  Note that the vacfs does not  support
       writing.

       -D     Print styx trace messages.

       -d     Print debug messages.

       -p     Disable permission checking.

       -a address
              Dial address instead of the default venti server.

BUGS
       Vacfs needs more testing.
       When  the  venti  connection  is  broken,  directories appear
       empty.
