NAME
       seconds,  ticks,  HZ,  MS2HZ,  MS2TK,  TK2MS, TK2SEC - kernel
       times and time conversions

SYNOPSIS
       long    seconds(void)

       ulong   ticks(void)

       #define HZ          ...
       #define MS2HZ(t)    ...
       #define TK2SEC(t)   ...
       #define TK2MS(t)    ...
       #define MS2TK(m)    ...

DESCRIPTION
       Seconds returns the system's idea of the current time as  the
       number of seconds since the start of the epoch (00:00:00 GMT,
       January 1, 1970).

       Ticks returns the  number  of  system-dependent  clock  ticks
       since system boot.

       The  system  clock  frequency is platform-dependent.  Several
       symbolic constants and macro functions  are  defined  by  the
       file mem.h to convert between different time units:

       HZ     The number of clock ticks per second.

       MS2HZ  Milliseconds per clock tick.

       TK2SEC(t)
              Convert t clock ticks to seconds and return the result
              (truncating not rounding).

       TK2MS(t)
              Convert t clock ticks to milliseconds and  return  the
              result.

       MS2TK(m)
              Convert  m  milliseconds to clock ticks and return the
              result (truncating).

       The functions are often used to calculate delays  for  timing
       functions, for instance:

              if(atactlrwait(dp->cp, DHmagic, 0, MS2TK(100))){
                      ...
              }
