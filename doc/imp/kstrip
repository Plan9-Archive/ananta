KSTRIP(10.1)                                            KSTRIP(10.1)

NAME
       kstrip - remove symbols from kernel images

SYNOPSIS
       kstrip file ...

       kstrip -o ofile file

DESCRIPTION
       Kstrip  removes  symbol table segments from executable files,
       rewriting the files in  place.   Stripping  a  file  requires
       write permission on the file and the directory it is in.

       If  the  -o  flag  is  given,  the  single input file file is
       stripped and the result written to ofile.  File is unchanged.
