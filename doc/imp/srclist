NAME
       srclist - list source files used to build an executable

SYNOPSIS
       srclist [ -ce ] [ -r rootdir ...  ] executable

DESCRIPTION
       Srclist prints on standard output, one per line, the names of
       source files used to build the given executable, which should
       be in a.out(10.6) format.

       By  default, all source file names are listed.  The -c option
       restricts the output to names ending  `.c'.   The  -e  option
       restricts  the  output  to  file  names that currently exist.
       Each -r option adds a new root directory rootdir to an inter‚Äê
       nal  list.   Only the names of source files that appear below
       one of the root directories will be printed.
