NTSRV(10.1)                                              NTSRV(10.1)

NAME
       ntsrv - start hosted Inferno as Windows service

SYNOPSIS
       ntsrv add svcname rootdir cmd [arg ... ]

       ntsrv del svcname

DESCRIPTION
       Ntsrv  is  a  command  (for  Windows only) that allows hosted
       Inferno to run automatically as a Windows service, under Win‚Äê
       dows  2000  and  XP.  For Windows NT, use the command ntsrv4,
       which otherwise has  identical  interface.   Svcname  is  the
       (proposed)  Windows  service name; rootdir is the root of the
       Inferno directory tree, including  the  drive  letter.   Once
       added,  a service can be controlled using the Windows service
       manager: it may be stopped, started, or have  its  attributes
       changed.   Svcname is set to start automatically when Windows
       starts up.  Services run by default under the  local  Windows
       `System'  identity.   All  Windows  processes and threads the
       service creates (eg, using cmd(3))  are  destroyed  when  the
       service  is  stopped.   There may be many different services,
       each with a distinct svcname.

       Ntsrv 's first parameter tells it what to do:

       add    Add a new  service  svcname  that  when  started  will
              invoke  emu(1) to run the Inferno command cmd with any
              additional arguments.

       del    Delete an existing service svcname.

       Ntsrv requires the directory  rootdir/Nt/386/bin  to  contain
       both emu.exe (ie, emu(1)) and ntsrv.exe itself.
