DBSRV(7)          Miscellaneous Information Manual          DBSRV(7)

NAME
       dbsrv - ODBC database server

SYNOPSIS
       lib/dbsrv alg ...

DESCRIPTION
       Dbsrv is normally configured to be run by svc(8) on a machine
       that acts as database server, for access through  the  module
       db(7).

       The  incoming  call  is  authenticated  by  security-auth(2).
       After successful authorisation, the client can request that a
       digest  and/or encryption algorithm be applied to protect the
       data exchanged with the server.  Each alg names a  digest  or
       encryption algorithm that the server will allow the client to
       use, in any form accepted by ssl(3); the  special  name  none
       means that ssl need not be used.

       The  implementation  of dbsrv relies on a program external to
       Inferno, infdb, which translates between the  db(7)  internal
       format  for requests, and data base access calls on the host.
       Dbsrv invokes infdb using the cmd(3) device.  Currently infdb
       is  implemented only under Windows/NT, giving access via ODBC
       to a Microsoft Access data base.
