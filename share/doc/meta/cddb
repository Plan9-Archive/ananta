CDDB(7)           Miscellaneous Information Manual           CDDB(7)

NAME
       cddb - CD database

SYNOPSIS
       cddb [ -DTt ] [ -s server ] query diskid ntracks track0id ...

DESCRIPTION
       Cddb  queries an Internet database to get a table of contents
       and other details for audio CDs.  The CD has ntracks  tracks,
       and  trackNid  is  a hash value derived from the N'th track's
       characteristics; diskid is a hash of all the track IDs.

       Cddb takes 4 optional arguments.  The -s server option causes
       cddb  to  use  a  different  server for the query (default is
       freedb.freedb.org).  The -D option causes  the  raw  database
       response  from  the  server  to be dumped to standard output.
       The -t option causes the time of each track to be appended to
       the  normal output.  -T prints track times and adds a line at
       the end with the total time.
