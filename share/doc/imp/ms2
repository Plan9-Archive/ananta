MS2(10.1)                                                  MS2(10.1)

NAME
       ms2  -  convert  executable  or raw file to Motorola S record
       format

SYNOPSIS
       ms2 [ option ...  ] infile

DESCRIPTION
       ms2 converts the infile onto the standard output in  Motorola
       S record format. If the -b option is not given, the infile is
       presumed to be an executable, and the header and symbol table
       stripped.  If  the -b option is given, the file is treated as
       raw binary.  The options are:

       -d        Encode the data segment only.

       -s        Omit  the  end  record,  presumably  to  accomodate
                 poorly implemented decoders.

       -Taddr

       -Aaddr    Set the address of the text segment, i.e. the first
                 record output.  -a is an older, deprecated option.

       -Rn

       -pn       Set the page size in use by the linker.  -p  is  an
                 older, deprecated option.

       -b        The  infile  is  binary.  Ignores  the  -R  and  -d
                 options.

       -Saddr    Sets the entry address output in the end record.
