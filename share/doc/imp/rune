DESCRIPTION
       These  routines  convert  to  and  from a UTF byte stream and
       runes.

       Runetochar copies one rune at  r  to  at  most  UTFmax  bytes
       starting  at  s and returns the number of bytes copied.  UTF‐
       max, defined as 4 in <libc.h>, is the maximum number of bytes
       required to represent a rune.

       Chartorune  copies  at most UTFmax bytes starting at s to one
       rune at r and returns the number of  bytes  copied.   If  the
       input  is  not exactly in UTF format, chartorune will convert
       to Runeerror (0xFFFD) and return 1.

       Runelen returns the number of bytes  required  to  convert  r
       into UTF.

       Runenlen  returns the number of bytes required to convert the
       n runes pointed to by r into UTF.

       Fullrune returns 1 if the string s of length n is long enough
       to  be  decoded by chartorune and 0 otherwise.  This does not
       guarantee that the string  contains  a  legal  UTF  encoding.
       This  routine is used by programs that obtain input a byte at
       a time and need to know when a full rune has arrived.

       The following routines are  analogous  to  the  corresponding
       string routines with utf substituted for str and rune substi‐
       tuted for chr.

       Utflen returns the number of runes that  are  represented  by
       the UTF string s.

       Utfnlen  returns the number of complete runes that are repre‐
       sented by the first n bytes of UTF string s.  If the last few
       bytes  of  the  string  contain  an  incompletely coded rune,
       utfnlen will not count them; in this  way,  it  differs  from
       utflen, which includes every byte of the string.

       Utfrune  (utfrrune)  returns  a  pointer  to the first (last)
       occurrence of rune c in the UTF string s, or 0 if c does  not
       occur  in  the  string.  The NUL byte terminating a string is
       considered to be part of the string s.

       Utfutf returns a pointer to the first occurrence of  the  UTF
       string  s2  as  a UTF substring of s1, or 0 if there is none.
       If s2 is the null string, utfutf returns s1.
