NEWNS(2)                 System Calls Manual                NEWNS(2)

NAME
       Newns:  newns,  newuser  -  build  a  new  name  space from a
       description file

SYNOPSIS
       include "newns.m";
       ns := load Newns Newns->PATH;

       newns:   fn(user: string, nsfile: string): string;
       newuser: fn(user: string, cap: string, nsfile: string): string;

DESCRIPTION
       Newns reads file nsfile and builds a new name space based  on
       the commands it contains.  The file has the format defined by
       namespace(6).  If nsfile is nil or empty, then newns attempts
       to read file the file namespace.

       Newuser  uses  a capability cap suitable for cap(3) to change
       the current process's user name to user, and uses  newns  and
       nsfile to build it a new name space.  The capability is typi‐
       cally obtained via factotum(4).
