BUFIO-CHANFILL(2)        System Calls Manual       BUFIO-CHANFILL(2)

NAME
       bufio: chanfill - buffered I/O interface to named channel

SYNOPSIS
       include "bufio.m";
       chanfill := load ChanFill ChanFill->PATH;

       init:   fn(data: array of byte, fid: int,
                   wc: Sys->Rwrite, r: ref Sys->FileIO,
                   b: Bufio): ref Bufio->Iobuf;
       fill:   fn(b: ref Bufio->Iobuf): int;

DESCRIPTION
       ChanFill  is  an  implementation  of BufioFill (see bufio(2))
       that refills an Iobuf as data is written to a file created by
       sys-file2chan(2),  which  is  allowed  only one writer.  Init
       returns an Iobuf allocated from the Bufio  instance  b,  that
       when  read  will  return  data written to the file by another
       process.  Data, fid and wc are the values in the  tuple  pre‐
       sented  by  Sys->file2chan  on the first write.  Data becomes
       the initial data for the Iobuf; init replies to the writer on
       wc.   The  other  values  are saved for use by fill: on later
       calls to by Bufio to refill the buffer, fill waits for a  new
       write  request  on  fio.write  and either fills the buffer or
       signals end-of-file appropriately.
