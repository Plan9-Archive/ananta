SYS-SEEK(2)              System Calls Manual             SYS-SEEK(2)

NAME
       seek - change file offset

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       seek:  fn(fd: ref FD, off: big, start: int): big;

DESCRIPTION
       Seek  sets  the 64-bit offset for the file associated with fd
       as follows:

              If start is Sys->SEEKSTART, the offset is set  to  off
              bytes.

              If  start  is Sys->SEEKRELA, the pointer is set to its
              current location plus off.

              If start is Sys->SEEKEND, the pointer is  set  to  the
              size of the file plus off.

       The new file offset value is returned.

       Seeking  in a pipe is not allowed.  Seeking in a directory is
       allowed only if the new offset is zero.
