NAME
       smtp - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

SYNOPSIS
       include "smtp.m";
       smtp := load Smtp Smtp->PATH;

       open:     fn(server: string): (int, string);
       sendmail: fn(fromwhom: string,
                    towhom: list of string,
                    cc: list of string,

DESCRIPTION
       Smtp  provides  an  interface  to the mail transport protocol
       SMTP.

       Open opens a connection to the given SMTP server.  If  server
       is  nil,  open uses the default mail server $smtp, which must
       be defined in ndb(6).  It returns -1 and an error message  if
       the connection fails.

       Sendmail  sends mail to the SMTP server for subsequent deliv‚Äê
       ery.  The first argument names the sender,  the  list  towhom
       names  the  recipients, cc is a list of CC's, and msg has the
       text of the message. The latter may simply be a list  of  one
       item  containing  the  whole  message, a list of lines of the
       message or any intermediate format.  It  returns  -1  and  an
       error message on failure.

       Close closes the connection to the SMTP server.

BUGS
       Too  much  copying  of strings is done, especially with large
       messages.
