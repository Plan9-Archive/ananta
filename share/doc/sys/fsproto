FSPROTO(2)               System Calls Manual              FSPROTO(2)

NAME
       FSproto:  readprotofile,  readprotostring  - read file system
       prototype file

SYNOPSIS
       include "fsproto.m";
       fsproto := load FSproto FSproto->PATH;

       Direntry: type (string, string, ref Sys->Dir);

       init:   fn(): string;

       readprotofile: fn(proto: string, root: string,
               entries: chan of Direntry,
               warnings: chan of (string, string)): string;

       readprotostring: fn(proto: string, root: string,
               entries: chan of Direntry,
               warnings: chan of (string, string));

DESCRIPTION
       FSproto provides an interface to read a file system prototype
       file, as defined by proto(6).

       Init must be called before any other function in the module.

       Readprotofile  reads  a  file  system prototype from the file
       proto.  It traverses the file system, starting at  the  given
       root,  and  each  file  or directory encountered that is men‐
       tioned in the prototype causes readprotofile to send a Diren‐
       try  tuple  on  the  channel entries.  The tuple has the form
       (old,new,dir) where old is the name of the  current  file  or
       directory,  rooted at root, new is the same file's name rela‐
       tive to root, and dir is a reference to the  Sys->Dir  direc‐
       tory  information  for old, as produced by sys-stat(2).  When
       all files in root have been examined, readprotofile  sends  a
       single  tuple  with  all nil components on entries.  For each
       error that occurs during processing (eg,  unable  to  open  a
       directory)  readprotofile  sends  a  tuple  (old,diag) on the
       channel warnings, naming the file  and  giving  a  diagnostic
       string, but processing continues.

       Readprotostring reads a file system prototype from the string
       proto itself.  Otherwise, its operation is the same as  read‐
       protofile.
