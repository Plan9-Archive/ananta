= remove: remove a file from a server

    size[4] Tremove tag[2] fid[4]
    size[4] Rremove tag[2]

The  remove  request  asks the file server both to remove the
file represented by fid and to clunk the  fid,  even  if  the
remove  fails.  This request will fail if the client does not
have write permission in the parent directory.

It is correct to consider remove to be a clunk with the  side
effect of removing the file if permissions allow.
