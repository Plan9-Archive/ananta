REMOVE(5)                File Formats Manual               REMOVE(5)

NAME
       remove - remove a file from a server

SYNOPSIS
       size[4] Tremove tag[2] fid[4]
       size[4] Rremove tag[2]

DESCRIPTION
       The  remove  request  asks the file server both to remove the
       file represented by fid and to clunk the  fid,  even  if  the
       remove  fails.  This request will fail if the client does not
       have write permission in the parent directory.

       It is correct to consider remove to be a clunk with the  side
       effect of removing the file if permissions allow.

ENTRY POINTS
       Remove messages are generated by remove (see sys-remove(2)).
