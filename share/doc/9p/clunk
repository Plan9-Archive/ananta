CLUNK(5)                 File Formats Manual                CLUNK(5)

NAME
       clunk - forget about a fid

SYNOPSIS
       size[4] Tclunk tag[2] fid[4]
       size[4] Rclunk tag[2]

DESCRIPTION
       The  clunk  request  informs the file server that the current
       file represented by fid is no longer needed  by  the  client.
       The  actual  file is not removed on the server unless the fid
       had been opened with ORCLOSE.

       Once a fid has been clunked, the same fid can be reused in  a
       new walk or attach request.

       Even  if  the  clunk  returns  an error, the fid is no longer
       valid.

ENTRY POINTS
       A clunk message is generated when a file descriptor is closed
       (usually  by  the  garbage collector) and indirectly by other
       actions such as failed open calls.
