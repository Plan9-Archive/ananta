NAME
       iostats - file system to measure I/O

SYNOPSIS
       iostats [ -d ] [ -f dbfile ] cmd [ args...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Iostats  is  a  file  server that interposes itself between a
       program and a copy of the current name space, which allows it
       to  gather  statistics of file system use at the level of the
       file system protocol of intro(5).  When the program exits,  a
       report is printed on standard error.

       The  report  consists  of  three sections.  The first section
       reports the amount of user data in read  and  write  messages
       sent  by  the  program and the average rate at which the data
       was transferred.  The protocol line  reports  the  amount  of
       data  sent  as  message  headers, that is, protocol overhead.
       The rpc line reports the total number of file system transac‐
       tions.

       The second section gives the number of messages, the fastest,
       slowest, and average turn around time and the amount of  data
       involved  with each 9P message type.  The final section gives
       an I/O summary for each file used by the program in terms  of
       opens, reads and writes.

       The  -d  option  causes  iostats  to write a debugging log to
       dbfile (default: iostats.out) that records all protocol  mes‐
       sages.

EXAMPLE
       Display summary of file I/O incurred by ls(1):

              iostats ls

       Start  a  new  shell, displaying all 9P traffic caused by the
       shell or its children:

              iostats -df /fd/1 sh

SOURCE
       /appl/cmd/iostats.b

BUGS
       Poor clock resolution means that large amounts of I/O must be
       done to get accurate rate figures.

       Can  be  fooled  by programs that do fresh mounts outside its
       purview.

       Cannot monitor standard input or output.
