= namespace: structure of conventional name space

While any structure is valid, many programs assume the following tree.

    /                      root (the install directory)
    |     /* MOUNT POINTS */
    |-- dev                devices (e.g., cons(3))
    |-- env                env(3)
    |-- mnt                applications
    |-- chan               files created with sys-file2chan(2)
    |-- net                network interfaces
    |-- n                  file trees on local or remote systems

== minimal namespace

The minimum structure necessary to function is

    /dis
    /dev
    /env
    /chan
    /net
    /prog
    /tmp
    /mnt
    /n

In addition, the following are required if running a server:

    /keydb/keys          see keyfs(4), logind(8) and signer(8)
    /keydb/signerkey     see createsignerkey(8) and logind(8)

or a window manager:

    /fonts               at least one font
    /icons/tk            any necessary icons
    /user/_name_         at least one if logon(1) is desired

    intro(1), root(3), namespace(6)
