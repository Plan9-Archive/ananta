NAME
       idea - encrypt/decrypt a file with the IDEA cipher

SYNOPSIS
       idea [ -e ] [ -d ] key [ datafile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Idea  encrypts or decrypts data using the IDEA (International
       Data Encryption Algorithm) cipher first  proposed  by  Xuejia
       Lai and James Massey in 1990.

       The  -e  option  encrypts the data and the -d option decrypts
       the data. Exactly one of these must be specified on the  com‚Äê
       mand line.

       The  key  is any 16 character string which is used as the key
       for both encryption and decryption.

       The data to be encrypted/decrypted is either in  datafile  or
       is  read  from standard input. If no input file is given, the
       output from idea is  always  sent  to  standard  output.  For
       encryption,  if an input file is specified the output is sent
       to a file with the name datafile.id.  For decryption,  if  an
       input  file  is  specified it should have a .id extension and
       the output is sent to a file whose name is that  of  datafile
       without the .id extension.

EXAMPLES
       Encrypt the data in the file A10076795.gz:

              idea -e 'abcd2345 $+*LMNO' A10076795.gz

       The  encrypted  data is put in the file A10076795.gz.id. Once
       this file is transmitted, the receiver can then  decrypt  it,
       as long as he has the key, with:

              idea -d 'abcd2345 $+*LMNO' A10076795.gz.id

       The decryped data is put in the file A10076795.gz.

       Note  that  the  quotes around the key are interpreted by the
       shell and simply delimit the key string.
