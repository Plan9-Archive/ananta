WISH(1)                General Commands Manual               WISH(1)

NAME
       wish - interface to the Tk graphics toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       wish [ file ...  ]

       wm/wish [ -k ] [ -f file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Wish  provides  a  Tcl command line interface to the Limbo/Tk
       graphics toolkit.  The input should be in the format  of  Tcl
       or Tk commands (see intro(9)).  There are two variants.

       Plain  wish  must  be run from the Inferno console instead of
       mux(1) or wm(1).  It takes input from each file in turn, then
       prompts  for  further  commands from the standard input.  Its
       commands operate on a Tk toplevel covering the whole screen.

       Wm/wish runs instead in a shell window under wm(1).  It reads
       initial  input  from the optional file, then prompts for fur‐
       ther commands on its standard input unless the -k  option  is
       given.  Its commands operate on the Tk toplevel of a new win‐
       dow created  by  Wmlib->titlebar  (see  wmlib(2)),  initially
       titled WishPad.

       The following special input sequences are recognised:

       \n     newline

       \t     tab

       \b     backspace

       \\     backslash

FILES
       /dev/pointer
       /dev/keyboard

SEE ALSO
       sh-tk(1), tkcmd(1), tk(2), intro(9)

BUGS
       Arguably  this  has been superseded by sh-tk(1) for scripting
       Tk applications, and tkcmd(1) for development and testing  of
       Tk configurations for use by Limbo programs.

                                                             WISH(1)
