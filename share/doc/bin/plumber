PLUMBER(8)             System Manager's Manual            PLUMBER(8)

NAME
       plumber - plumber for interapplication message routing

SYNOPSIS
       plumber [ -v ] [ -w ] [ -c wmchan ] [ rulefile ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Plumber  provides high-level message-passing between applica‐
       tions.  In a plumbed environment,  applications  can  receive
       messages  on  an  input  port, which is given a logical name.
       Messages are not sent directly between applications  but  are
       routed via the plumber, following user-specified rules.

       Plumber  is  typically started by wm(1)'s startup script.  It
       reads  each  rulefile  (default:  /usr/user/lib/plumbing)  in
       turn.   Each  file has the form described in plumbing(6); the
       rules direct the routing of each  message  plumber  receives.
       Plumber  then lurks in the background with its mate, awaiting
       plumbing requests sent by plumbmsg(2), by windowing  applica‐
       tions  in  response  to events such as button clicks or drag-
       and-drop, or by plumb(1).

       When a message arrives, plumber applies the rules  to  decide
       how  to  route  it.   It forwards the message to the selected
       application's input port, starting it if  necessary.   If  no
       rule applies (or some other error occurs), plumber returns an
       error to the message's sender.  The -v option causes  plumber
       to  log  the  contents of messages it receives, to help debug
       plumbing rules and applications.

       Plumber normally starts applications directly.   For  use  on
       devices that have specialised window managers, not wm(1), the
       -w option causes plumber to start applications indirectly, by
       sending  a message to a window manager listening on /chan/wm,
       allowing  the  window  manager  to  track  every  application
       started.   The  -c option can select an alternative wmchan to
       /chan/wm.
