NS(1)                  General Commands Manual                 NS(1)

NAME
       ns - display current namespace

SYNOPSIS
       ns [ -r ] [ pid ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ns  displays  the  construction of the namespace of the given
       pid, or its own (as inherited) by default.  Based on the con‚Äê
       tents  of  /prog/pid/ns,  it  prints  on  standard  output  a
       sequence of bind and mount commands (see bind(1)) that  might
       reconstruct  the  same  name space if executed.  In practice,
       mounts of services such as ftpfs(4) often refer to the  names
       of  pipe ends that are now inaccessible.  Furthermore, if any
       file involved has been renamed since the mount or  bind,  the
       original name of the file is shown.

       Mounts of file services on a network show the network address
       as given to dial(2) instead of the name of the data file  for
       the  connection; the -r option causes ns to show the raw file
       name instead.
