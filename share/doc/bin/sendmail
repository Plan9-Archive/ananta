SENDMAIL(1)            General Commands Manual           SENDMAIL(1)

NAME
       sendmail - send mail messages

SYNOPSIS
       sendmail [ recipient ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sendmail  sends  mail to each recipient named as an argument.
       It reads its standard input to get the text of  the  message.
       If no recipient is named, the recipient(s) will be taken from
       the message header.

       The mail message is scanned for lines beginning and
       If no `from' line is found, the sender is assumed to  be  the
       current  user.  The  recipient(s)  of the message can be men‚Äê
       tioned as arguments or in a list of names in a line  but  not
       as both.  If the sender's name is unqualified (is just a user
       name), sendmail appends the value of the environment variable

       Sendmail delivers the mail using the  module  smtp(2),  which
       connects  to  a mail server running the Simple Mail Transport
       Protocol (SMTP), using the  symbolic  host  name  $MAILSERVER
       (see db(6)).
