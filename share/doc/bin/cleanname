NAME
       cleanname - clean a path name

SYNOPSIS
       cleanname [ -d dir ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       Cleanname tidies up each file name it is given and prints the
       result on standard output.  It removes redundant slashes  and
       interprets  and  directory names lexically.  If the -d option
       is given, each name that does not not start with / or #  will
       be prefixed by dir/ before processing.
