PLUMB(1)               General Commands Manual              PLUMB(1)

NAME
       plumb - send message to plumber

SYNOPSIS
       plumb  [  -s  src  ] [ -d dest ] [ -w wdir ] [ -t type ] [ -a
       name value ] [ -i ] data ...

DESCRIPTION
       Plumb sends a message to the plumber,  plumber(8),  which  is
       normally started by wm(1)'s start up script.

       The  options and arguments are used as components of the mes‐
       sage.  See plumbing(6) for their interpretation.  The options
       are:

       -s src Set the source to src (default: unspecified).

       -d dest
              Set the destination to dest (default: unspecified).

       -w wdir
              Set  the  working  directory to wdir (default: current
              directory as reported by pwd(1) or workdir(2)).

       -t type
              Set the type of data to type (default: text)

       -a name value
              Include an attribute `name=value'; there can  be  more
              than one.

       -i     Take  the  data  from  the standard input not from the
              argument strings.  If an action attribute is not  oth‐
              erwise  specified,  plumb  will add an action=showdata
              attribute to the message.

       The remaining arguments are sent, separated by spaces, as the
       data of the message.  The plumber will apply its rules to the
       resulting message to decide how to route it.
