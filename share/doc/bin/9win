9WIN(1)                General Commands Manual               9WIN(1)

NAME
       9win - create a Plan 9 window within Inferno

SYNOPSIS
       9win [ -s ] [ -x width ] [ -y height ] [ cmd [ arg ...  ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       9win creates a window for a graphical Plan 9 command (default
       rio) to run in. If provided, width and height give a  desired
       width  and  height for the new window.  Cmd gives the command
       to run, and arg its arguments.

       The -s option tells 9win to  run  in  server  mode.  Used  by
       9cpu(1),  it  exports on its standard input a namespace suit‐
       able for a graphical Plan 9 program to run within. With  this
       option, no command may be given.

BUGS
       9win  does  not export a full rio environment, so Plan 9 pro‐
       grams that wish to create new windows will not work correctly
       (unless running inside a rio started by 9win)
