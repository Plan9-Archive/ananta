CHANGELOGIN(8)         System Manager's Manual        CHANGELOGIN(8)

NAME
       changelogin, convpasswd - create/update the password file

SYNOPSIS
       auth/changelogin name

       auth/convpasswd [ -f ] [ -v ] [ -m keydir ] [ pwfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Changelogin  helps  to administer a password file /keydb/keys
       (see  keys(6)),  a  requirement  of  `signer'  servers   (see
       logind(8),  signer(8),  and svc/auth in svc(8)).  Changelogin
       can only be used on the signing host itself,  after  keyfs(4)
       has  been started (eg, by svc/auth) to make the entries visi‐
       ble in the name space.

       If a password file entry for name  exists,  it  is  modified;
       otherwise,  a new entry is created.  The user is prompted for
       the following items:

       password
              A string at least 8 characters in  length.  The  SHA-1
              digest of the entered string is stored in the password
              file. See keyring-sha1(2).  By default,  the  password
              for an existing entry is unchanged.

       expiration date
              An  expiration  time in the format DDMMYYYY.  The user
              input is checked for valid day, month, and year; more‐
              over,  the  new  date  must  be later than the current
              time.  By default,  the  current  value,  if  any,  is
              unchanged  for an existing entry and one year from the
              current time for a new entry.

       Note that the password expiration date is also  used  as  the
       default  expiration  date for any certificate later produced;
       see getauthinfo(8).

       Convpasswd converts a Third  Edition  password  file  to  the
       keys(6)  file  used by the current Edition of the system.  It
       reads  password  entries  from  pwfile,  /keydb/password   by
       default,  and  writes corresponding entries into a name space
       served by keyfs(4), mounted at keydir, /mnt/keys by  default.
       It copies passwords and expiry times.  The `free form' admin‐
       istrative data is discarded.  If keydir already  has  got  an
       entry  for  a user, it is left as-is, unless the -f option is
       given to force convpasswd to copy across the entry in  pwfile
       .   The  -v  option causes convpasswd to print each user name
       after it successfully installs it.
