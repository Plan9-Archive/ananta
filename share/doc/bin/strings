NAME
       strings - extract printable strings

SYNOPSIS
       strings [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Strings finds and prints strings containing 6 or more consec‐
       utive  printable  UTF-encoded  characters  in  a  (typically)
       binary  file,  default  standard input.  Printable characters
       are taken to be ASCII characters  from  blank  through  tilde
       (hexadecimal 20 through 7E), inclusive, and all other charac‐
       ters from value 00A0 to FFFF.  Strings  reports  the  decimal
       offset  within  the  file  at which the string starts and the
       text of the string. If the string is longer than 70 runes the
       line  is terminated by three dots and the printing is resumed
       on the next line with the offset of the continuation line.
