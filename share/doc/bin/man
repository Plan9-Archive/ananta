DESCRIPTION
       Both man and wm/man locate entries in this manual and display
       them.   The  pages for entries named title within each speci‐
       fied section are displayed.  If no  sections  are  specified,
       matching  pages  from all sections are printed.  Sections are
       given by number.

       The -f option to man and wm/man prevent lookup in the  manual
       index.  Instead, the remaining arguments are treated as file‐
       names.  Man processes each file in turn.   Wm/man  adds  each
       file  to  its page history and displays the first document in
       the list.

       The man command prints the manual pages  as  formatted  plain
       text  to  standard  output.   Manual  pages are written using
       Plan9 troff -man macros for their markup and so  some  detail
       is  lost  in  conversion  to plain text.  Wm/man displays the
       pages in a graphical Wm window,  providing  a  more  faithful
       reproduction of the intended layout.

       Man also accepts the following options:

       -b     Print  the  pages and send them to plumber(1) for dis‐
              play in an editor.

       -n     Use man2txt to format the pages (default).

       -p     Display the pages using wm/man.

       -S     Do not search the manual indices for the  names:  only
              print pages whose file names match the titles.

       -w     Print  the  names of the man page source files instead
              of formatting them.

       Man2html converts troff -man macro markup to an approximation
       in  HTML on standard output.  Only one file is processed at a
       time.  It is assumed the input file is a manual page, in  the
       given  section  (default:  1).   The  optional  header string
       replaces the default header <HTML><HEAD>.  The optional  ini‐
       tial text will appear immediately after <BODY>.  The optional
       trailer string replaces the default trailer </BODY></HTML>.

       Man2txt converts troff -man macro markup to plain text.  Each
       file  is  processed  separately.   If no arguments are given,
       text from standard input is processed.  The converted text is
       written  to standard output.  The -p option to man2txt speci‐
       fies the page width in characters.

       Lookman finds the manual pages, in any section, that  contain
       all  of  the keywords given as arguments, and prints man com‐
       mands and manual references for them, one per line.  In a wm-
       sh(1)  window,  any  of the man commands can be selected with
       mouse button 2 and sent as a command; a manual reference  can
       simply  be  plumb(1)'d  using  mouse button 3.  The -f option
       causes lookman just to list the file names.

       Sig prints the type signature - parameters and return types -
       of each function found in section 2 of this manual.

FILES

BUGS
       Man2txt only knows about  troff  -man  macros.   Other  troff
       macro  packages  or  output from preprocessors such as pic or
       tbl will not be presented correctly.
