MV(1)                  General Commands Manual                 MV(1)

NAME
       mv - move files

SYNOPSIS
       mv fromfile tofile
       mv fromfile ...  todir

DESCRIPTION
       Mv  moves  fromfile  to tofile.  If the files are in the same
       directory, fromfile is simply renamed; a previously  existing
       file  named tofile will be (silently) removed.  Otherwise, mv
       copies fromfile  to  tofile,  then  removes  fromfile.   This
       requires   write   permission   for  the  parent  directories
       involved.

       If the last argument is a directory,  the  earlier  arguments
       (all files) will be moved into that directory. Any previously
       existing files of the same name will be overwritten.   Direc‚Äê
       tories  can  only  be  renamed:  mv  refuses to move one into
       another.
