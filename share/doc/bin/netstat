NETSTAT(1)             General Commands Manual            NETSTAT(1)

NAME
       netstat - summarize network connections

SYNOPSIS
       netstat

DESCRIPTION
       Netstat  prints  information  about network connections.  The
       following is presented for each connection:

              connection name: the protocol and conversation  direc‚Äê
              tory in /net (eg.  tcp/8)
              user name
              status of the connection
              address  of  each  end  of the connection (eg host and
              port if IP)

       The information is obtained from  the  status  file  of  each
       entry  under  the  network directories /net/tcp, /net/udp and
       /net/il.

       Netstat relies on a populated /net directory; the  #I  device
       must therefore have previously been bound there.
