LIMBO(1E)                                                  LIMBO(1E)

NAME
       limbo - Limbo compiler

SYNOPSIS
       limbo [ option ... ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Limbo compiles the named Limbo files into machine-independent
       object files for the Dis virtual machine.  Depending  on  the
       options, the compiler may create output files or write infor‐
       mation to its standard output.  Conventional files and  their
       extensions include the following.

       file.b    Limbo source file.

       file.dis  Object code for the Dis virtual machine.

       file.m    Limbo source file for module declarations.

       file.s    Assembly code.

       file.sbl  Symbolic debugging information.

       With  no  options, limbo produces a .dis file for each source
       file.

       The compiler options are:

       -a        Print on standard output type definitions and  call
                 frames  useful  for  writing C language implementa‐
                 tions of Limbo modules.  Suppresses  normal  output
                 file generation.

       -C        Mark the Dis object file to prevent run-time compi‐
                 lation.

       -c        Mark the Dis object file to guarantee run-time com‐
                 pilation.

       -D flags  Turn  on  debugging  flags.   Flags  include  A for
                 arrays, a for alt statements, b for booleans, C for
                 case  body statements, c for case statements, D for
                 use descriptors, d for declarations, e for  expres‐
                 sions,  E  for extended expressions, F for function
                 information, f for constant folding, m for modules,
                 n for nil references, P for program counter manipu‐
                 lations, r for reference types, S for  type  signa‐
                 tures,  s  for  a  code  generation  summary, T for
                 tuples, t for type checking,  and  v  for  variable
                 initialization.

       -e        Increase  the  number  of  errors the compiler will
                 report before exiting.

       -G        Annotate assembly language  output  with  debugging
                 information.  A no-op unless -S is set.

       -g        Generate  debugging information for the input files
                 and place it in  a  file  named  by  stripping  any
                 trailing  .b from the input file name and appending
                 .sbl.

       -i        Disable inlining of functions. Currently  functions
                 containing  a single return statement or two return
                 statements and an  if  clause  are  candidates  for
                 inlining.

       -I dir    An  include  file  whose  name  does not begin with
                 slash is  sought  first  relative  to  the  working
                 directory,  regardless of the source file argument.
                 If this fails, limbo sequences through  directories
                 named  in -I options, then searches in /module.  An
                 include file contains Limbo source  code,  normally
                 holding one or more module declarations.

       -o obj    Place  output in file obj (allowed only if there is
                 a single input file).  The output  file  will  hold
                 either  object  or  assembly code, depending on -S.
                 Default is to take the last element  of  the  input
                 file  name,  strip any trailing .b, and append .dis
                 for object code and .s for  assembly  code.   Thus,
                 the  default  output  file  for  dir/mod.b would be
                 mod.dis.

       -S        Create assembly language output instead  of  object
                 code.

       -T module Print  on  standard output C stub functions, useful
                 for implementing Limbo modules in  the  C  language
                 for linkage with the interpreter.

       -t module Print  on  standard output a table of runtime func‐
                 tions, to link C language implementations  of  mod‐
                 ules with the Limbo interpreter.  Suppresses normal
                 output file generation.

       -w        Print warning messages about unused variables, etc.
                 More  w's  (e.g., -ww) increase the pedantry of the
                 checking.
