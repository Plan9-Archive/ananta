MANGALOAD(8)           System Manager's Manual          MANGALOAD(8)

NAME
       mangaload - send new kernel to MANGA bootstrap

SYNOPSIS
       auxi/mangaload [ -48dr ] host image

DESCRIPTION
       Mangaload  uses an ICMP protocol unique to the Peplink MANGA™
       firewall to send a new kernel image to  the  MANGA  bootstrap
       monitor  to  burn  into  flash, replacing the existing kernel
       image.  To start the loading process, connect to the device's
       console  on its serial port (38400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1
       stop bit, no flow control), power  the  device  off  then  on
       again,  and  when  the MANGA prompt appears, quickly type the
       letter f.  Then run mangaload to load the kernel; the  device
       should  give  status  updates  as the kernel loads, and as it
       burns the image into flash.  When it has finished, power  the
       device off and on again to start the new kernel.

       By  default, mangaload assumes a 4 Mbyte flash on the device;
       the -8 option sets it to 8 Mbytes.  The -r option causes  the
       image to be loaded into another, larger flash region, used by
       Linux for its initial root, which can be used by Inferno  for
       general  storage.  The -d option prints a trace of the proto‐
       col, for debugging.
