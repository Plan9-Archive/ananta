SNTP(8)                System Manager's Manual               SNTP(8)

NAME
       sntp - simple network time protocol client

SYNOPSIS
       ip/sntp [ -di ] [ server ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sntp  is a simple client for the Simple Network Time Protocol
       (RFC1361).  It requests the time from  the  SNTP  service  on
       server  (default: udp!$ntp!ntp), and if it receives a plausi‐
       ble reply, sets the local time accordingly,  in  both  rtc(3)
       and  /dev/time.  The -d option prints debugging text, includ‐
       ing the time received; the -i option stops sntp from actually
       updating the local time.
