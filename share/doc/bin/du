DU(1)                  General Commands Manual                 DU(1)

NAME
       du - disk usage

SYNOPSIS
       du [ -anstu ] [ -b blocksize ] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Du  writes  to standard output the total size of files speci‐
       fied as arguments.  Directories are recursively  tallied.   A
       summary line is produced for each argument file and subdirec‐
       tory.  If no filenames are provided, the command operates  on
       the current directory.

       Output  sums  are  rounded  up  to  the nearest 1k unit (1024
       bytes).  By default, storage is assumed to  be  quantised  in
       units  of  1024 bytes.  The -b option sets a different block‐
       size for quantisation, optionally suffixed by k for units  of
       kilobytes; output is still in 1k units.

       Du accepts the following options:

       -a     Output  usage  information  for all subordinate files,
              not just directories.

       -n     Output just the  filenames  (but  see  the  -t  option
              below); implies -a.

       -s     Print only the summary line for each file.

       -t     Display  the last-modified time for each file, not its
              size; when used with the -n option, outputs the  file‐
              name,  modification  time  (seconds  since the epoch),
              size (in bytes), and checksum.  The checksum field  is
              always 0; it is a place-holder for a value computed by
              another command in a pipeline.

       -u     Display the last-accessed time for each file, not  its
              size.
