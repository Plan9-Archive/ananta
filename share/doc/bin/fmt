NAME
       fmt - simple text formatter

SYNOPSIS
       fmt [ -l n ] [ -i n ] [ -j ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Fmt copies the given files (standard input by default) to its
       standard output, filling and indenting  lines.   The  options
       are

       -l n   Output  line  length  is  n, including indent (default
              70).

       -w n   A synonym for -l.

       -i n   Indent n spaces (default 0).

       -j     Do not join short lines: only fold long lines.

       Empty lines and initial white space in input lines  are  pre‚Äê
       served.  Empty lines are inserted between input files.

       Fmt   is   idempotent:   it  leaves  already  formatted  text
       unchanged.
