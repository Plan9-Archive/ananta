SYNOPSIS
       echo [-n] [arg ...]

       echo [-n] [arg ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Echo  writes its arguments separated by blanks and terminated
       by a newline on the standard output.   Option  -n  suppresses
       the newline.

       A  version  of  echo  can optionally be loaded into the Shell
       sh(1) if need be, to make shell scripts a little faster.
