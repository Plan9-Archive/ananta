GRID-QUERY(1)          General Commands Manual         GRID-QUERY(1)

NAME
       grid:  query  -  graphical interface to view resources regis‐
       tered with a known registry(4)

SYNOPSIS
       grid/query

DESCRIPTION
       Query displays the  resources  currently  registered  with  a
       given  registry(4)  and  allows  the user to mount and browse
       through the namespaces they provide.

       Resource categories are displayed in the main window, opening
       any  of  these (by clicking on the '+' next to the name) will
       reveal the names of the individual resources within that cat‐
       egory.  Each  resource  has  a set of attributes which may be
       viewed at the lowest level of the displayed tree. Clicking on
       a  specific  resource  and  clicking  the  Mount  button that
       appears will mount that resource (if  possible)  and  display
       the imported namespace in a new window. From this window, the
       user can then browse this namespace as well  as  opening  and
       running  files.  A  shell  window may also be opened to allow
       more complicated tasks to be performed.

       Clicking Search brings up a search window. Here, the  current
       registry(4)  may  be  searched  for a resource containing the
       specified attribute names and values.   Refresh  updates  the
       list  of  resources  in the main window in case any have been
       added or removed.

BUGS
       Currently, searching for a resource on a registry(4) is  only
       implemented  in a very simple way. Given the attribute (name,
       value) pairs, the search  will  return  all  resources  whose
       attributes exactly match the specified values.  * may be used
       to match any attribute value but not name.
