NAME
       audio - Inferno audio file format

DESCRIPTION
       Inferno  audio  files  accepted by commands such as auplay(1)
       have a simple format.  The file contains a header  consisting
       of  non-empty  lines  of  text specifying the data format and
       characteristics, followed by an empty line, followed  by  the
       audio  data  in binary form.  The data can be copied directly
       to a suitable audio device (see audio(3))  correctly  config‐
       ured, using read, write or stream (see sys-read(2)).

       Each header line corresponds to a command that can be written
       to the control file audioctl of  the  audio(3)  device.   The
       first  line  of the header must be a rate command; other com‐
       mands can appear in any order.  The commands available are:

       rate n The data was recorded at n Hz, typically one of 44100,
              22050, 11025 or 8000 but other values are legal.

       chans n
              There are n channels of audio data (eg, 1 for mono and
              2 for stereo).

       bits n Each sample is n bits (typically 8 or 16).

       enc e
              The string e gives the recording format, and will usu‐
              ally  be  one  of  the  following:  ulaw, alaw, pcm or
              adpcm.

       The audio data is stored with a sample from each  channel  in
       turn  (`left'  sample first if stereo, regardless of encoding
       or data size).  Data encoded as  pcm  is  little-endian,  2's
       complement   if  16-bit,  but  unsigned  if 8 bit.  The adpcm
       encoding uses 4-bit samples (two mono samples or  one  stereo
       sample per byte, again little-endian).
