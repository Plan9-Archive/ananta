KILL(1)                General Commands Manual               KILL(1)

NAME
       kill, broke - terminate process(es)

SYNOPSIS
       kill [ -g ] [ pid ...  ] [ module ...  ]

       broke [ user ]

DESCRIPTION
       Kill  terminates  each process (for a numeric process ID pid)
       or process running a given module (for a  non-numeric  module
       name),  by  writing  a message to the corresponding process's
       control file in prog(3).  The -g option causes kill to  write
       a  message  instead,  killing  all  processes  in  the  given
       process's process group (see sys-pctl(2)).  Processes running
       a  module are identified by their file, and the process ID of
       each such process is printed on standard output.

       A process that incurs an exception (eg, array  bounds  check)
       is  normally  suspended in the `broken' state to allow debug‚Äê
       ging.  Broke finds all such processes owned by user (default:
       the  current  user), and prints sh (1) commands to kill them.
       The commands can be piped to the shell  or  selectively  run,
       releasing  back  to  the  system any resources owned by those
       processes.
