OS(1)                  General Commands Manual                 OS(1)

NAME
       os - interface to host OS commands (hosted Inferno only)

SYNOPSIS
       bind -a '#C' /
       os  [  -b  ] [ -m mountpoint ] [ -d dir ] [ -n ] [ -N level ]
       cmd [ arg...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Os uses a cmd(3) device to execute a command, cmd, on a  host
       system.   If  the  -m  option is given, os uses the device at
       mountpoint, otherwise it is asssumed to be at  /cmd,  and  is
       bound into the local namespace if necessary.

       The  -d option causes the command to run in directory dir; an
       error results and the command will not run if  dir  does  not
       exist  or  is inaccessible.  The standard output and standard
       error of the command appear on the standard output and  stan‐
       dard  error  streams of the os command itself.  Os copies the
       standard input to the remote command's standard input;  redi‐
       rect os's input to /dev/null if there is no input to the com‐
       mand.  Os terminates when  cmd  does,  and  its  exit  status
       reflects the status of cmd (if available).

       If  the  os command is killed or exits (eg, for lack of input
       and output), the host's own process  control  operations  are
       used  to  (attempt to) kill cmd, if it is still running.  The
       -b (background) option suppresses that behaviour.

       The -n option causes cmd to run with less than normal  prior‐
       ity  (`nice').  The -N option sets low priority to a particu‐
       lar level from 1 to 3.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The exit status of os reflects any  error  that  occurs  when
       starting cmd and, if it starts successfully, the status of os
       is the exit status of cmd.
