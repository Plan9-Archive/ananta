RDBGSRV(8)             System Manager's Manual            RDBGSRV(8)

NAME
       rdbgsrv - remote debug server

SYNOPSIS
       bind -b '#t' /dev

       auxi/rdbgsrv [ -dn ] [ -sbaud ] [ -fdev ] mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       Rdbgsrv  interposes  itself  between dev (default: /dev/eia0)
       and mountpoint to convey 9P messages via the serial  port  to
       and  from  a  9P  server  program  running on a board running
       native Inferno.  The -f option specifies the  serial  device;
       the default is /dev/eia0.  The -s option sets the line speed;
       the default is 38400 baud.  The -d option  selects  debugging
       options by a bit mask: 1, print trace of 9P message types; 2,
       print actual 9P message contents.

       The monitor program on  the  board  must  be  started  first.
       Rdbgsrv writes the two byte message go, and keeps reading the
       device until it sees the reply ok.  It then attempts to mount
       the  exported  name space, and copies 9P messages to and from
       the device.

       Once rdbgsrv is running, any device  files  provided  by  the
       program will be visible at mountpoint.
