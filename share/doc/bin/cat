CAT(1)                 General Commands Manual                CAT(1)

NAME
       cat - concatenate files

SYNOPSIS
       cat [ - ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Cat  reads  each  file  in turn and writes it on the standard
       output.  Thus

              cat file

       prints the file to standard output, and the following

              cat file1 file2 >file3

       concatenates two files onto a third.

       If no file is given, or where - is given as an argument,  cat
       reads  from the standard input.  Output is buffered in blocks
       matching the input.

BUGS
       Beware of cat a b >a and cat a b >b which destroy input files
       before reading them.
