READ(1)                General Commands Manual               READ(1)

NAME
       read - read from standard input with optional seek

SYNOPSIS
       read [ -[eor] offset ] [ count ]

DESCRIPTION
       Read  does a single read of count bytes (default: 8192 bytes)
       from the standard input and writes the result to the standard
       output.   If the optional offset argument is given, read will
       first apply sys-seek(2):

       -o offset
              seek offset bytes from the start of the file

       -e offset
              seek offset bytes from the end of the file

       -r offset
              seek offset bytes from the  standard  input's  current
              file offset

       In all cases the file offset changes to reflect the result of
       the seek, and the number of bytes read.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Read prints a diagnostic and returns a non-empty exit  status
       on  an  I/O  error;  it  quietly  returns  status if the read
       returns zero bytes (conventionally, end of file).
