DMVIEW(1)              General Commands Manual             DMVIEW(1)

NAME
       dmview, dmwm - view remote displays

SYNOPSIS
       wm/dmview address

       wm/dmwm [ -p port ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dmwm  is  run  in  place  of the usual Inferno window manager
       wm(1), to allow the display's contents  to  be  viewed  else‐
       where.  Dmwm waits for incoming viewing requests on the given
       TCP/IP port (default: 9998).   On  each  connection  attempt,
       dmwm  prompts  the user to accept or reject the request for a
       remote view.

       Dmview opens a connection to an instance of dmwm at the given
       network  address  and, if the remote user accepts the connec‐
       tion, opens a new window on dmview's own  display  that  con‐
       tains a replica of the remote display.
