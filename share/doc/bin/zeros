ZEROS(1)               General Commands Manual              ZEROS(1)

NAME
       zeros - write sequence of bytes

SYNOPSIS
       zeros [ -r ] [ -vvalue ] [ [ blocksize...  [ numblocks ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zeros  writes  a  sequence  of  bytes to standard output. The
       arguments specify the nature of  the  bytes,  block  size  in
       bytes,  and  the  number  of blocks to output.  The -r option
       requests that each block be the same, but randomly generated.
       The  -vvalue  option sets the value of each byte (default 0).
       Typically zeros has a specialised use: ensuring  a  file  has
       the  desired  number  of  blocks  in it to hold a file system
       image, before reaming it.

EXAMPLE
       To create and initialize a file system containing  2048  1024
       byte blocks

              zeros 1024 2048 >kfs.file
              mount -c {disk/kfs -r kfs.file} /n/local
