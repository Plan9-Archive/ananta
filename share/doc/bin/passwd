PASSWD(1)              General Commands Manual             PASSWD(1)

NAME
       passwd - change user password

SYNOPSIS
       auth/passwd [ -u user ] [ -s signer ] [ keyfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Passwd  changes the secret shared between the invoker and the
       authentication server signer (default: $SIGNER).  The  signer
       must offer the keysrv(4) service.

       The  secret  is  associated with a remote user name that need
       not be the same as the name of the invoking user on the local
       system.   That remote user name is specified by a certificate
       signed by signer, and obtained from keyfile.  Keyfile identi‐
       fies  a file containing a certificate (default: If keyfile is
       not  an  absolute   pathname,   the   file   used   will   be
       /usr/user/keyring/keyfile.   User  by default is the invoking
       user's name (read from /dev/user), but the -u option can name
       another.

       Passwd  connects to the signer, authenticating using the cer‐
       tificate in keyfile, and checks that the user in the certifi‐
       cate  is  registered  there  with an existing secret.  Passwd
       then prompts for the (remote) user's old secret,  to  double-
       check  identity,  then  prompts  for a new one, which must be
       confirmed.

       Secrets must be at least eight characters long.  Try to  make
       them hard to guess.
