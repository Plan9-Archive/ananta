COOK(1)                General Commands Manual               COOK(1)

NAME
       cook - SGML converter

SYNOPSIS
       cook [ -f format ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Cook  reads a file in SGML format and produces an interpreta‐
       tion of the file in either LaTex or HTML format  on  standard
       output.

       If no infile argument is present, the standard input is read.
       If an outfile argument is present, the results are written to
       that  file  instead  of standard output.  The format argument
       must be either html to produce HTML format output or one  of:
       latex,  latexbook,  latexpart,  latexproc,  or latexslides to
       produce LaTex output.

       The latexpart format assumes that the resulting output is  to
       be  included in the body of a controlling LaTex document. The
       other LaTex format options result in the generation of  vari‐
       ous LaTex wrapping commands.

       Cook was designed to operate on the output of the Brutus edi‐
       tor (See brutus(1) ) and so  its  mapping  of  SGML  tags  is
       closely linked to those generated by brutus.

       The  following  tags are recognised: Author, Bold.n, Caption,
       Example, Exercise, Extension, Float, Heading,  Index,  Index-
       topic,  Italic.n, Label, Label-ref, List, List-elem, No-fill,
       Par, Roman.n, SGML, Title, and Type.n, where n is a character
       point size and must be one of: 6, 8, 10, 12 or 16.

       tain the SGML tag <SGML> and nothing else.
