DESCRIPTION
       Create  copies files from the file tree source (default /) to
       an output file in archive format appropriate for  a  software
       distribution.  The  name  of the output file is the time that
       the archive was made. The latter includes wrap  headers  that
       describe the distribution.  Name is typically the name of the
       product or software package. The -p option specifies the pro‐
       totype file proto to use to build the archive.

       Each line of the proto file specifies a file to copy.  Inden‐
       tation is significant, with each level of indentation  corre‐
       sponding  to  a level in the file tree.  Fields within a line
       are separated by white space.  The first field  is  the  last
       path  element in the destination file tree.  The second field
       specifies the permissions.  The third field is the  owner  of
       the  file,  and the fourth is the group owning the file.  The
       fifth field is the name of the file from which to copy;  this
       file is read from the current name space, not the source file
       tree.  All fields except the first are optional.

       Names beginning with a are expanded as environment variables.
       If  the  first  file  specified  in a directory is all of the
       files in that directory are copied.  If the first file is all
       of  the non-directory files in that directory are copied.  If
       the first file is all of the files are copied, and all subdi‐
       rectories are recursively copied.

       Files  in the source tree that are not specified in the proto
       file are not placed in the archive.

       The remaining options to create are:

       -u        Build an update distribution  rather  than  a  base
                 distribution.  In this case name should be the name
                 of the previous archive file built for  this  prod‐
                 uct.  Only  files that are out of date with respect
                 to the latter are included in  the  archive.  Files
                 which no longer exist will be marked for removal.

       -U        Build  an update package distribution instead. This
                 is a hybrid of a base distribution  and  an  update
                 distribution.

       -v        Print out the files as they go into the archive.

       -x        Print  out the files that would go into the archive
                 but do not actually archive them.

       -o        Copy the archive file to the standard output rather
                 than putting it in a date stamped output file.

       -r root   Specifies the location of any previous archives for
                 this product.

       -N uid    Give all the files in the archive the user id spec‐
                 ified.

       -G gid    Give  all  the  files  in  the archive the group id
                 specified,

       -d description
                 Give a description of  the  distribution.  This  is
                 placed in the wrap header files.

       Inst  installs  archive  files  made by create .  Name is the
       name of the archive file to install. Any further names  after
       this  are  treated as path prefixes and only files in the ar‐
       chive that have  one  of  the  given  prefixes  are  actually
       installed.  The option to inst are :

       -c        Carry  on regardless when errors occur. The default
                 behaviour is to exit on encountering an error.

       -h        Only print the names of the files in the archive.

       -t        Give each installed file the  same  date  stamp  as
                 indicated by that file's entry in the archive.

       -u        Give  each installed file the same date stamp, user
                 id and group id as shown in the archive.

       -v        Print out the names  of  directories  as  they  are
                 installed.

       -F        Force  the installation of the files in the archive
                 even when the corresponding local file  has  appar‐
                 ently been locally updated or already exists.

       -r root   Specifies  the  root  of destination tree where the
                 files will be copied to.

       Info prints information about either a specific file produced
       by create or about all files making up a package in the /wrap
       tree. In particular base packages, full updates  and  partial
       updates  are  distinguished.  The -r option specifies the the
       root of the tree to look in. This defaults to /.

EXAMPLES
       Make an archive to  establish  a  new  base  package  for  an
       Inferno distribution:

              install/create -o -N inferno -G inf -d InfernoOS -p PROTO Inferno.1.0 > inferno.arch

       Here the name of the product is Inferno.1.0.

       Install that archive on another machine:

              install/inst -r / inferno.arch

       Here  the  product is placed in / with the user and group ids
       being set to those of the person doing the installation.
