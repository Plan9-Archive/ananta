NDB(6)                      Games Manual                      NDB(6)

NAME
       ndb - network data base

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/ndb/local
       /lib/ndb/inferno
       /lib/ndb/dns
       /lib/ndb/common

DESCRIPTION
       Network  configuration data is stored in one or more files in
       the directory /lib/ndb, in the  attribute  data  base  format
       defined  by  attrdb(6).   Most applications that use it start
       with /lib/ndb/local by default.   That  can  refer  (using  a
       database  entry)  to  other  files that form part of the same
       logical database.  They are stored in distinct files to allow
       different configurations to avoid duplicating data by sharing
       some common content.  For example, /lib/ndb/common associates
       service  names  with port numbers for Internet protocols, and
       /lib/ndb/inferno provides the Inferno-specific port  mapping.
       A  database is automatically reread if any component file has
       changed since it was last read  (based  on  its  modification
       time).

       A  network database gives particular meaning to the following
       attributes:

       auth   name or address of authentication server

       bootf  name of the file to send to a device on  request  when
              booting

       dns    name  or  address  of  DNS  resolver  (see also the ns
              attribute below)

       dnsdomain
              domain in which the local host lives (used to  qualify
              unqualified names)

       dom    Internet domain name (host or DNS zone)

       ether  Ethernet address in the form accepted by ether(2)

       fs     name or address of file server

       il     IL service name

       infernosite
              empty-valued attribute that labels default site param‐
              eters

       ip     Internet address

       ipgw   name or address of Internet gateway

       ipmask Internet network mask

       ipnet  network or subnetwork name

       ipv4proto
              IPv4 protocol number (see also protocol)

       mx     mail exchanger

       ns     name of a DNS name server for an associated dom

       port   port number for a service

       protocol
              protocol name

       soa    start of area (value is empty  if  locally  authorita‐
              tive,  or  `delegated' if another server is authorita‐
              tive)

       sys    system name (short local name for a host)

       tcp    TCP service name

       udp    UDP service name

       Internet addresses and masks  can  be  written  in  any  form
       accepted  by  Ip(2).   Network  applications  might use other
       attributes of their own, which they  document  on  their  own
       pages.

       Cs  (8)  interprets a host name of the form $server as refer‐
       ring to the set of names and addresses that are values of the
       attribute  server  in  the  network data base.  Attributes in
       general use include some of those above, and the following:

       FILESERVER
              older name for file server fs file server

       pop3   mail reading service using the POP3 protocol

       PROXY  firewall proxy for ftpfs(4)

       SIGNER Inferno authentication server running logind(8) and/or
              signer(8)

       smtp   mail delivery gateway using the SMTP protocol

       Other  such symbolic server names are mentioned in the manual
       pages for associated applications.

       Dns(8) interprets dns and dnsdomain values in any infernosite
       entry,  and  dom,  ip,  and  ns  values more generally.  When
       resolving a domain name, dns looks first in this data base to
       see  if there is a dom entry for the name, and if so, whether
       there is either an associated  ns  attribute  giving  a  name
       server  to  ask,  or  an  ip  attribute  giving the name's IP
       address.  Failing that, it works up the name hierarchy  look‐
       ing  for  name  servers to ask.  Failing that, it looks for a
       dnsdomain entry with dns attributes listing  other  resolvers
       to  ask.   Bootstrap data is commonly stored in /lib/ndb/dns;
       by default it defines the root name servers:

              dom=    # root
                   ns=a.root-servers.net
                   ns=b.root-servers.net
                   ...
              dom=a.root-servers.net ip=198.41.0.4
              dom=b.root-servers.net ip=128.9.0.107
                   ...

EXAMPLE
       Specify the site's default DNS domain name and resolvers  for
       dns(8), and a collection of symbolic service names for cs(8):

              infernosite=
                   dnsdomain=vitanuova.com
                   dns=200.1.1.11
                   dns=158.152.1.58
                   dns=158.152.1.43
                   SIGNER=doppio
                   FILESERVER=doppio
                   smtp=doppio
                   pop3=doppio
                   PROXY=doppio
                   GAMES=vivido
                   IRMSERVER=vivido
