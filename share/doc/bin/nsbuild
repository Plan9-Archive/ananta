NSBUILD(1)             General Commands Manual            NSBUILD(1)

NAME
       nsbuild - build Inferno namespace

SYNOPSIS
       nsbuild [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Nsbuild  builds  a  file  name space for Inferno.  It reads a
       file (by default, a file  called  namespace  in  the  current
       directory)  and  interprets  the name space commands found in
       that file.

       The commands executed by nsbuild include bind and mount.  See
       namespace(6) for details on the format of the file.

FILES
       namespace      The default namespace file.

SOURCE
       /appl/cmd/nsbuild.b

SEE ALSO
       bind(1), cd(1), newns(2), namespace(6)

BUGS
       The  new  and fork operations of namespace(6) are ineffective
       because nsbuild runs as a separate process.
