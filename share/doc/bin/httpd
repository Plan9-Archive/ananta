NAME
       httpd, echo, stats - HTTP server

SYNOPSIS
       svc/httpd/httpd [ -a addr ] [ -c cachesize ] [ -D ]

       svc/httpd/echo meth vers uri search

       svc/httpd/stats meth vers uri search

DESCRIPTION
       Httpd  is  a  simple  HTTP daemon, serving version 1.0 of the
       HTTP protocol.  It listens for  incoming  calls  on  a  given
       address  (default: tcp!*!80).  It serves content rooted at in
       its name space.

       The httpd program supports only the and methods of  the  HTTP
       protocol.  The (default and (default of a file are determined
       by  looking  for  suffixes  of  the  file   name   in   /ser‐
       vices/http/http.suff.

       If  the  requested  URI  begins with /magic/, httpd loads the
       module associated with the remaining part of the  URI.   Take
       care  to  configure  the name space sensibly.  Simple servers
       echo and stats are provided (see below).

       Httpd has the following options:

       -a address
              Listen for calls on the given address, expressed using
              the syntax of dial(2).

       -c cachesize
              Set  the size of the daemon's cache to cachesize kilo‐
              bytes. The default is a five megabyte cache.

       -D     Debugging information is written  to  the  file  /ser‐
              vices/httpd/httpd.debug.

       Echo  is  a trivial server that just returns the method, URI,
       any search, and the headers sent by the client.

       Stats is an equally simple server that queries the cache  and
       returns  information  to  the  user about pages stored in the
       cache.

       More complex services  can  be  written  to  httpd's  private
       interface.   The  file  httpd.m  (in /appl/svc/httpd) defines
       constants and adts used by httpd.  The file cgi.m defines the
       module  which  is the interface for programs called using the
       URI /magic/.

FILES
       /services/httpd/root
              Root of the served web content.

       /services/httpd/httpd.debug
              Logfile for debugging information.

       /services/httpd/httpd.log
              httpd logfile.

       /services/httpd/httpd.rewrite
              File to redirect specific URI requests.

       /services/httpd/httpd.suff
              File of recognizable suffixes and their content type.
