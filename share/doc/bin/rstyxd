RSTYXD(8)              System Manager's Manual             RSTYXD(8)

NAME
       rstyxd - Styx-based remote execution and file service

SYNOPSIS
       auxi/rstyxd alg ...

DESCRIPTION
       Rstyxd  provides  a  remote-execution service.  Having autho‐
       rised the client and optionally established ssl, as described
       above,  it  reads a single line from its standard input.  The
       line contains a decimal value that is the count of the number
       of  bytes that follow, which rstyxd reads as a utf(6)-encoded
       string.  The string contains a command, which is parsed  into
       arguments,  following  the quoting conventions of sh(1).  The
       first argument is the command name.  Rstyxd prepares a  modi‐
       fied  name  space in which to run the command.  It mounts the
       connection (standard input) on /n/client, binds /n/client/dev
       onto  /dev,  and  opens  the  new  /dev/cons  (ie, the remote
       client's /dev/cons) on file descriptors 0, 1 and 2.  Finally,
       it executes the command.

       Rstyxd  is normally started by svc(8) in response to incoming
       network calls.  It expects the standard input to be connected
       to  the  client;  unusually, it is both read and written.  It
       first authenticates the incoming call  using  keyring-auth(2)
       via   security-auth(2).   On  successful  authorisation,  the
       server sets its user identity to that of the caller, and  the
       client  can request that a digest and/or encryption algorithm
       be applied using ssl(3) to protect the  data  exchanged  with
       the  server.  Each alg names a digest or encryption algorithm
       that the server will allow the client to  use,  in  any  form
       accepted  by ssl; the special name none is usually listed, to
       allow the client to choose not to use ssl.
