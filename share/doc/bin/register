REGISTER(8)            System Manager's Manual           REGISTER(8)

NAME
       register  -  command  to  register  set-top-box identity with
       signer

SYNOPSIS
       mux/register [ signer ]

DESCRIPTION
       Register is intended for use on a set  top  box  (or  similar
       device).  It connects to signer, a machine configured to sign
       certificates, and obtains an authenticated certificate  based
       on  the  contents of (the set top box ID in non-volatile mem‐
       ory).  The certificate is saved in the file  for  later  use.
       If  no signer is named explicitly, the $SIGNER named in db(6)
       is used instead.

       There are several phases to obtaining the certificate.

       1.     The register command interacts with signer(8)  on  the
              signing  host  to construct the certificate. This cer‐
              tificate is `blinded' by a random bit mask, sent  back
              to  register which displays it in textual or graphical
              form to the user.

       2.     The user running register  must  use  an  independent,
              secure  mechanism  (for example, an untapped telephone
              call) to communicate with a human agent  at  the  site
              acting   as  signer.   That  agent  runs  verify  (see
              signer(8)) to display the same  `blinded'  certificate
              that was shown to register's user at the client.  Once
              the agent is convinced that the `blinded'  certificate
              has  been  delivered  to  the correct party, the agent
              tells verify to accept the identity of the caller.

       3.     Register then connects to  the  countersigner  process
              (see  signer(8))  to  obtain  the  bitmask  needed  to
              `unblind' the previously received  certificate.   This
              step  can only validly be performed after the success‐
              ful completion of verify on the signer.
