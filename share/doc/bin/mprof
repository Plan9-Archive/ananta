NAME
       mprof, wm/mprof - memory profiling limbo programs

SYNOPSIS
       mprof [ -bcMflnve123 ] [ -m modname ] ...  [ cmd arg ...  ]

       wm/mprof [ -e12 ] [ -m modname ] ...  [ cmd arg ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mprof  is a simple memory profiling tool which calculates the
       amount of main, heap and image memory used  on  a  particular
       line  of  limbo  source  or in a particular limbo function or
       module. The main memory in question covers the space taken by
       dis code, jit code, runtime stacks and dynamic C module text,
       data and relocation areas. The heap memory covers  all  other
       limbo  data structures. The source in question should be com‐
       piled with the -g flag so  that  the  relevant  symbol  table
       files  exist. In its simplest form, the memory profiler shows
       a line number, the current memory  in  bytes  allocated  when
       executing this line, the high water memory in bytes allocated
       when executing this line and the limbo source. This  informa‐
       tion is also available at the function and module level.

       The  tk  version of the profiler wm/mprof shows this informa‐
       tion in a text widget and colours the lines of source accord‐
       ing to the amount of memory allocated by the line. The darker
       the colour, the more memory used.

       The -b option starts profiling.

       The -c option clears all profiling statistics  and  state  in
       the memory profiling device. If any commands are specified to
       mprof , this is done automatically. It's specific use  is  to
       end  the  accumulation  of statistics when profiling interac‐
       tively. See the example below.

       The -M option shows the memory statistics for each module The
       -f option shows the memory statistics for each function.

       The  -l  option shows the memory statistics for each line. If
       neither this option nor the -M and -f options are  given,  -M
       and -l are assumed.

       The  -n option lists the name of the file along with the line
       number.

       The -v option outputs all functions and/or  lines  even  when
       they do not involve memory allocating or freeing operations.

       The  -m  option  lists  the module names which are to be pro‐
       filed. If none are given, all the modules loaded by the  ker‐
       nel  will be profiled. The name may be the actual name of the
       module or its path name.

       The -e option profiles the module that is loaded first in any
       following command. In this case there is no need to give a -m
       option as this is added automatically.

       The -1 option profiles only main memory (pool number 1 in the
       kernel).  The default is to profile main, heap and image mem‐
       ory.

       The -2 option profiles only heap memory (pool number 2 in the
       kernel).  The default is to profile main, heap and image mem‐
       ory.

       The -3 option profiles only image memory (pool  number  3  in
       the  kernel).  The default is to profile main, heap and image
       memory.

       Any remaining arguments are assumed to specify a command  and
       set  of  arguments to the command. If this is the case, mprof
       will automatically start profiling, run the command  to  com‐
       pletion  and  then  stop profiling before showing the profile
       statistics.

       Mprof displays the profile statistics (unless the  -b  option
       is being used) according to the output format required.

EXAMPLE
       To profile a particular command
            mprof /dis/math/parts 10000
            wm/mprof /dis/math/parts 10000
       To profile the same command but restrict attention to its own module (Partitions).
            mprof -m Partitions /dis/math/parts 10000
            wm/mprof -m Partitions /dis/math/parts 10000
       A shorter version of the above
            mprof -e /dis/math/parts 10000
            wm/mprof -e /dis/math/parts 10000
       To profile interactively
            mprof -b -m Polyhedra
            wm/polyhedra &
            mprof -M -f -l -n
            <interact with wm/polyhedra ...>
            mprof -M -f -l -n
            wm/mprof
            mprof -c

       Note  that the output format options ( -M , -f , -l , -n , -v
       ) are ignored when -b is present.

BUGS
       Can take quite a time to present  statistics  when  profiling
       all modules in the system.
