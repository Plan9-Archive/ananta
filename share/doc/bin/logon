LOGON(1)               General Commands Manual              LOGON(1)

NAME
       logon - log on to Inferno

SYNOPSIS
       [ wm/wm ] wm/logon [ -l ] [ -n nsfile ] [ -u user ]

DESCRIPTION
       Logon logs a user in to the Inferno environment.  It requires
       wm (1) to be started first.  If no user name is specified  by
       the  -u  option,  logon  displays a login panel to prompt for
       one.  The user name must have a  directory  /usr/user,  which
       will  become  the  current directory.  (Otherwise, logon will
       display a diagnostic panel and prompt again.)  The user  name
       is written to /dev/user (see cons(3)), which is the name pre‐
       sented on subsequent attaches to file servers.

       Normally, logon expects keyboard input to provide a name, but
       if the -l option is given, logon displays a list of the names
       in /usr, allowing one to be selected using a mouse  or  touch
       screen.

       Once  the current directory has been set, logon creates a new
       name  space  for  the  user  using  the  contents  of  nsfile
       (default:  namespace), as described in namespace(6).  It then
       starts toolbar(1) to provide the initial application environ‐
       ment.
