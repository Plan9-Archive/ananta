NAME
       telnet - make a remote telnet connection

SYNOPSIS
       telnet machine

DESCRIPTION
       Telnet  uses the Telnet protocol to talk to a remote machine,
       addressed using any form acceptable to dial(2): net!host!port
       in  general.  The default net is tcp, and the default port is
       23, the standard Telnet login port.

       Telnet connects to the given machine and interprets the  Tel‚Äê
       net  protocol.   It  reads  data  from its standard input and
       sends it to the remote machine, and copies  to  the  standard
       output the data it receives from the remote machine.
