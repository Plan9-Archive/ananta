NAME
       netkey - calculate response to authentication challenge

SYNOPSIS
       netkey

DESCRIPTION
       Netkey  calculates a response to a challenge made by a system
       to authenticate a user, based on a shared secret  (password),
       using the same algorithm as a SecureNet device.  It reads and
       writes /dev/cons.  It prompts once for the  secret  (echo  is
       turned  off).   It  then repeatedly prompts for a remote sys‚Äê
       tem's challenge, and once given it, calculates and prints the
       corresponding  response.   It  exits on an empty challenge or
       end of file.
