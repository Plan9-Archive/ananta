CREATESIGNERKEY(8)     System Manager's Manual    CREATESIGNERKEY(8)

NAME
       createsignerkey - create signer key on authentication server

SYNOPSIS
       auth/createsignerkey  [ -a alg ] [ -f keyfile ] [ -e expiry ]
       [ -b bitsize ] name

DESCRIPTION
       Createsignerkey creates public and private keys that are used
       by  a  server acting as `signer' to generate certificates for
       users.  Name appears as  signer  in  each  certificate.   The
       expiry  date  has  the form ddmmyyyy, is converted to seconds
       since the epoch (see daytime(2)) and stored in  the  keyfile;
       by default the server's certificate never expires.

       The key will be bitsize long (default: 512 bits) with a mini‚Äê
       mum of 32 bits and a maximum of 4096 bits.   Keyfile  is  the
       file  in  which  the  server  stores its keys; the default is
       /keydb/signerkey, and many authentication  programs  such  as
       logind(8)  by  default expect to find their server key there.
       Creating a signer's default key afresh typically  invalidates
       all  certificates  previously  issued by that signer, because
       their signatures will not verify.  The mode  of  the  keyfile
       should  be  set to be readable only by the user running those
       programs.

       The -a option specifies the signature  algorithm.   Currently
       alg  can  be either elgamal or rsa.  RSA keys are now used by
       default.
