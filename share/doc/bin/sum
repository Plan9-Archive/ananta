SUM(1)                 General Commands Manual                SUM(1)

NAME
       sum, md5sum, sha1sum - calculate file's checksum

SYNOPSIS
       sum file ...

       md5sum [ file  ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sum  prints  the  32-bit checksum (actually a CRC), length in
       bytes, and name of each  file,  one  per  line.   It  ignores
       directories.

       Md5sum  prints the MD5 message digest (as 32 hexadecimal dig‐
       its) and the name of each file, separated by a tab,  one  per
       line.  If no files are given, the standard input is read.

       Sha1sum  is  similar,  but  uses the US National Institute of
       Standards and Technology's secure hash algorithm SHA1 instead
       of MD5.  For each file, it prints its SHA1 secure hash (as 40
       hexadecimal digits) and the file's name, separated by a  tab,
       one per line.  If no files are given, sha1sum reads the stan‐
       dard input.
