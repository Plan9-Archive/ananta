USERS(6)                    Games Manual                    USERS(6)

NAME
       users - kfs file server user list format

DESCRIPTION
       The  permanent file server kfs(4) maintains a private list of
       users and groups, in /adm/users by convention.  Each line  in
       the file has the format

              num:name:leader:members

       where num is a decimal integer, name and leader are printable
       strings excluding the characters and and members is a  comma-
       separated  list  of such strings.  Such a line defines a user
       and a group with the given name; the group has a group leader
       given  by leader and group members given by the user names in
       members.  The leader field may be empty, in  which  case  any
       group  member  is  a  group leader.  The members field may be
       empty.

       Lines beginning with are ignored.

       The num in a line is a  number  used  internally  by  a  file
       server;  there  should  be  no duplicate nums in the file.  A
       negative num is special: a user with a  negative  num  cannot
       attach  to  the  file  server.  The file /adm/users itself is
       owned by user adm, having a negative num, and write protected
       to others, so it can only be changed via console commands.
