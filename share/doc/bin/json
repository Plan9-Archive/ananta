JSON(6)                     Games Manual                     JSON(6)

NAME
       json - javascript object notation

DESCRIPTION
       JSON is a textual data transport encoding for a small collec‐
       tion of basic and structured values: null, booleans, numbers,
       strings,  arrays, and objects (property/value list).  It is a
       subset of JavaScript (ECMAScript).  Json(2) describes a Limbo
       module that can read and write streams of JSON-encoded data.

       The  encoding  syntax  and  its  interpretation is defined by
       Internet RFC4627, but is briefly summarised here:

              text      ::=  array | object

              value     ::=   null | true | false | number | string | array | object

              object    ::=  '{' [pair (',' pair)*] '}'
              pair      ::=  string ':' value

              array     ::=  '[' [value (',' value)*] ']'

              number    ::=  int frac? exp?
              int       ::=  '-'? [0-9] | [1-9][0-9]+
              frac      ::=  '.' [0-9]+
              exp       ::=  [eE][-+]? [0-9]+

              string    ::=  '"' char* '"'
              char      ::=  [^\x00-\x1F"\\] |
                              '\"' | '\/' | '\b' | '\f' | '\n' | '\r' | '\t' |
                             '\u' hex hex hex hex
              hex       ::=  [0-9a-fA-F]

       A sequence of blank, tab, newline or carriage-return  charac‐
       ters  (`white  space') can appear before or after opening and
       closing brackets  and  braces,  colons  and  commas,  and  is
       ignored.   The null represents a null value of any type.  The
       strings in the pairs of an object are intended  to  represent
       member  names, and should be unique within that object.  Note
       that array and object denotations can be  empty.   Also  note
       that  the  RFC  wants  applications  to  exchange a text (ie,
       object or array) not an arbitrary value.
