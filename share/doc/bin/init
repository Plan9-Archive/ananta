INIT(8)                System Manager's Manual               INIT(8)

NAME
       init: emuinit, osinit - Inferno initialisation

SYNOPSIS
       Init: module
       {
            init: fn();
       };

       /dis/emuinit.dis

       #/./osinit.dis

DESCRIPTION
       Both  emu(1) and the native kernels run a Dis program to ini‚Äê
       tialise the system.

       Emuinit is the default  initialisation  program  for  emu(1).
       Emu  sets  the environment variable (see env(3)) /env/emuargs
       to the command line originally given to emu,  which  has  the
       following form:

              emu [-d] [ command [ arg ...]  ]

       Emuinit  uses the value of emuargs to decide which command to
       start and its arguments.  The default command is /dis/sh.dis,
       unless the -d option is given, in which case /dis/lib/srv.dis
       is used by default instead, to cause emu to run on  the  host
       system as a server (`daemon' mode).

       Osinit   is  built-in  to  the  root(3)  of  native  kernels.
       Although the kernel uses the fixed  name  #/./osinit.dis  the
       contents are taken from one of the files in /os/init selected
       by  the  init  section  of  the  kernel  configuration  file.
       Osinit's  action  is  platform-specific  in detail, but might
       include: building an initial /dev by mounting device drivers;
       binding  the physical network driver (eg, ether(3)) into /net
       and initialising ip(3), usually setting addresses and  routes
       using  bootp;  attaching  to a remote file system; setting up
       flash translation using ftl(3); starting  dossrv  or  9660srv
       (see  dossrv(4)), or kfs(3) to serve local files from disk or
       flash memory.
