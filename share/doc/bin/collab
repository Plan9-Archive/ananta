COLLAB(1)              General Commands Manual             COLLAB(1)

NAME
       collab: connect - connect to collaborative files and services

SYNOPSIS
       collab/connect  [ -C alg ] [ -k keyfile ] [ -v ] [ netaddress
       [ localdir ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Connect dials network  address  netaddr  (default:  net!$col‐
       lab!9999),  which  should be served by an instance of collab‐
       srv(8), and mounts the resulting connection on /n/remote;  it
       then    binds    /n/remote/collab   on   localdir   (default:
       /n/ftree/collab).

       The resulting hierarchy under /n/remote is determined by  the
       site   configuration,  but  usually  includes  the  directory
       /n/remote/services, which gives access to the server side  of
       collaborative  activities,  as described in collabsrv(8), and
       the directory /n/remote/collab, which contains the file hier‐
       archy  that contains all collaborative resources offered to a
       client device.

       If an instance of wm-ftree(1) is running  in  the  same  name
       space,  then  after mounting the connection and adjusting the
       name space, connect tells it that the name space has changed,
       so any displayed view of it can be updated.

       Connect accepts the following options:

       -C alg Specify  the  algorithm,  alg,  to  be  used following
              authentication for digesting or encryption. See ssl(3)
              for  the  supported  algorithms.  The default is none:
              ssl(3) is not used after authentication.

       -k kfile
              Specify the keyfile to be  used  when  authenticating.
              The  default  is  /usr/user/keyring/netaddr,  if  that
              exists, and otherwise /usr/user/keyring/default.   See
              keyring-auth(2) for more details.

       -v     Causes  connect  to chat about its actions on standard
              output.
