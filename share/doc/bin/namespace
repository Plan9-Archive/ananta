NAMESPACE(6)                Games Manual                NAMESPACE(6)

NAME
       namespace - name space description file

DESCRIPTION
       Namespace  files  describe how to construct a name space from
       scratch, or add to an existing name  space.   The  files  are
       interpreted by newns(2), invoked by commands such as logon(1)
       and by other system services.

       The name space description file contains one  or  more  lines
       each  of  which  specifies  one  name space operation.  Empty
       lines and lines with # as the first non-space  character  are
       ignored.    Environment  variables  of  the  form  $name  are
       expanded within arguments, where name is a string  terminated
       by white space, or one of the characters or

       The known operations and their arguments are:

       bind [-abci] old new
              Use  new  as  an  alias  for  file  or  directory old.
              Options  a,  b  and  c  translate   to   flag   values
              Sys->MAFTER,  Sys->MBEFORE  and  Sys->MCREATE  of sys-
              bind(2).  If neither a nor b are given, the default is
              Sys->MREPL.  Option i means to ignore errors.

       cd directory
              Change working directory to directory.

       fork   Split  the  name  space  before modification.  This is
              equivalent to passing a value of Sys->FORKNS  to  sys-
              pctl(2).

       mount  [-abc9i] [-k keyfile] [-C alg] [net!]machine[!svc] dir
       [spec]
              Mount the file tree of  machine  upon  directory  dir.
              The  default  service  is styx.  Options a, b, c and i
              are the same as for bind.  The  tokens  dir  and  spec
              translate to old and aname of mount as described under
              sys-bind(2).  The -k, -C and -9 options are  the  same
              as those for the mount command (see bind(1)).

       import [-abc9i] [net!]machine[!svc] [remotedir] dir
              Import  a  directory  from a remote Plan 9 machine and
              make it appear on directory dir.  Options a, b, c  and
              i are the same as for mount.  By default, remotedir is
              assumed to be the same name as dir.  The default  ser‐
              vice  is  exportfs.   (Currently  this operation works
              only under native Inferno and Plan 9.)

       new    Create a new name space in which the current directory
              becomes  the  root directory; typically used after cd.
              This is equivalent to passing a value of Sys->NEWNS to
              sys-pctl(2).

       nodev  Disallow device attaches.  This is equivalent to pass‐
              ing a value of Sys->NODEVS to sys-pctl(2).

       unmount [-i] [name] from
              If two arguments are given, undo a bind or mount  with
              the  same  arguments.   If only one argument is given,
              everything bound to or mounted on from  is  unmounted.
              The -i option means ignore errors.

       . path Include the name space description file path.
