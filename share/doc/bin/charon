CHARON(1)              General Commands Manual             CHARON(1)

NAME
       charon - web browser

SYNOPSIS
       charon [ -option [value] ] [url]

DESCRIPTION
       Charon  is  the  Inferno  graphical web browser, supporting a
       variety of web standards for the download,  viewing,  automa‐
       tion and navigation of web based information and images.

       The  browser runs under the wm(1) window manager, or directly
       on the draw(3) and cons(3) devices.  When charon  starts,  it
       checks  to see if wm is running; if it is then charon creates
       a new wm window for its display, otherwise it uses the  whole
       area of the display device.

       Charon  implements an image cache to help reduce the overhead
       of revisiting pages.  The image cache resides in  memory  for
       the  duration of a session.  The cache is managed by discard‐
       ing least recently used images once  the  cache  bounds  have
       been  reached.   Currently, charon does not provide a general
       purpose web cache; all other resources have  to  be  reloaded
       when needed.

   Navigation
       Charon  provides  navigation  controls  familiar  to any web-
       surfer: back, forward, reload,  home,  stop  and  URL  entry.
       Navigation  of web-based information is by means of following
       HTML links, this is done by clicking on them using mouse but‐
       ton-1,  or  the  touch-screen.   Clicking mouse button-2 on a
       link causes its address to be displayed in the status line of
       charon's   display.    Navigation  to  other  information  is
       achieved by clicking on the URL entry field  and  typing  the
       address of the resource, followed by the Enter key.

       The  retrieval  and processing of the current page is immedi‐
       ately terminated by clicking the Stop button.

       As resources are browsed, a history of  their  web  addresses
       (URLs)  is  built  up.  At any time you can navigate forwards
       and backwards through this list using the  Forward  and  Back
       buttons.  Additionally, clicking the History button, displays
       the entire history list as a set of links enabling  the  user
       to quickly jump to any position in the list.

       Sometimes,  it  is not possible to retrieve all of the compo‐
       nents of a web document at the time  that  it  is  requested.
       Often  this  is because the remote server is very busy or not
       available.  This can result in the presentation of the  docu‐
       ment being incomplete or even corrupted.  Clicking the Reload
       button causes charon to attempt to retrieve the current docu‐
       ment and all of its components again.

       Charon  displays  a  progress  panel to indicate the download
       status of each of the components  of  the  current  document.
       The  progress  panel is displayed at the bottom of the charon
       window.  Each component of the  current  document  is  repre‐
       sented  by a rectangular block in the progress panel.  As the
       download of a component progresses, its  corresponding  block
       is gradually filled in.  If an error occurs while downloading
       or processing the component, its block is coloured red.   The
       component  address and amount downloaded, or reason for fail‐
       ure, can be  obtained  by  clicking  mouse  button-1  on  its
       progress block.

   Web Standards
       Standards  are  the life-blood of the World-Wide-Web; without
       them, the web could not exist.  Web standards are under  con‐
       stant review with revised editions and complete new standards
       being published all of the  time.   This  section  lists  the
       standards  supported  by  charon  at the time of writing this
       manual entry.  The version  of  the  standard  is  given,  if
       appropriate, alongside any comments on its implementation.

       Protocols      HTTP versions 1.0 and 1.1

                      HTTPS:  SSL  Protocol  versions  2.0  and 3.0.
                      X.509.v3 server certificates.

                      FTP: charon supports retrieval of  plain  text
                      files  only, directory listings are not gener‐
                      ated.

                      FILE: Charon attempts to  determine  the  file
                      type  by  a combination of the filename exten‐
                      sion and examination of the first few bytes of
                      the  file.   Directory listings are not gener‐
                      ated.

       HTML           It is intended that charon supports HTML  ver‐
                      sion  3.2,  but  in reality there is no single
                      standard!  Charon attempts to be as  close  as
                      possible  to  Netscape  Navigator Version 3 in
                      terms of its markup support.  Obvious bugs  in
                      Navigator  3  and  the Netscape security model
                      have not been adopted.

       JavaScript     Charon implements ECMAscript-262 2nd  Edition,
                      which  is roughly equivalent to JavaScript1.1.
                      The ECMA-262 standard does not define the host
                      objects and classes that should implemented by
                      the browser.  Charon  implements  the  set  of
                      host objects and classes of Netscape Navigator
                      version 3.

       Encodings      US_Ascii,  ISO_8859_1,  UTF_8,  Unicode  (big-
                      endian)

       Images         GIF87a and GIF89a - animated GIFs always loop.
                      JPEG, XBitmap, Inferno BIT image(6) format.

   Configuration
       While  using  charon,  a sub-set of the configuration options
       can be modified.  Clicking the Configuration button  displays
       a  config  popup window, enabling the user to modify the cur‐
       rent values of the available options.

       The full set of configuration options can be modified on  the
       command line or in a configuration file.  Comand line options
       are processed after the configuration file.   The  configura‐
       tion  file  is loaded from /usr/user/charon/config where user
       is obtained by reading the file /dev/user.  If this file does
       not  exist,  the  file  /services/config/charon.cfg  is  read
       instead.  Options are processed in order; some options  over‐
       ride  settings  affected  by others and so the order in which
       they are used is important.

       Options are specified using a key, value pair.  On  the  com‐
       mand line this takes the form:

              -key value

       Where  -key  and  value  are individual items in the argument
       list to charon.

       In the config file options take the form:

              key=value

       Where value is the remainder of the input line after the  `='
       character.  Any text lines in the config file that start with
       a `#' character are ignored as comment lines.

OPTIONS
       userdir
              The directory where charon expects to find its config‐
              uration files such as, bookmark and cookie files.  The
              default  value  is  /usr/user/charon/  where  user  is
              obtained by reading the file /dev/user.

       starturl
              Specifies  the  URL  of  the first document to be dis‐
              played by charon at startup.   The  default  value  is
              file://localhost/services/webget/start.html

       homeurl
              Specifies the URL of the document to retrieve when the
              Home button is  clicked.   The  homeurl  can  only  be
              changed if the change_homeurl option is enabled.  Set‐
              ting homeurl  also  set  the  value  of  the  starturl
              option.   The  default  value is file://localhost/ser‐
              vices/webget/start.html

       change_homeurl
              Enables editing of the Home URL in  the  configuration
              popup  window.   A non-zero integer value enables this
              option, all other values disable it This  option  also
              enables the homeurl option.  The default value is 1.

       helpurl
              Specifies the URL of the document to retrieve when the
              Help  button  is  clicked.   The  default   value   is
              file://localhost/services/webget/help.html

       httpproxy
              Specifies  the  host  name  and  port  of  a web proxy
              server.  The address is given in the form  of  a  URL,
              where  the optional port number can be specified after
              the server name by separating them  by  a  colon  `:'.
              The default value is the empty string, specifying that
              no web proxy server should be used.

       noproxy or noproxydoms
              Specifies a list of network domains for  which  a  web
              proxy should not be used.  The domains in the list can
              be separated by semicolon, comma, space or tab charac‐
              ters.  The default value is the empty list.

       usessl Extends  SSL  support.  Accepted values are ``v2'' and
              ``v3''.  Initially  SSL  support  is  configured  off.
              Enabling  version 1 or version 2 support restricts SSL
              support to  that  specific  version.   Specifying  the
              option  twice,  once with each of the options, enables
              dual version SSL support whereby the remote server  is
              probed  to  determine which version it supports.  Some
              servers only support one of the versions and  may  not
              tolerate the special version2/3 probe.

       buttons
              Specifies the set of buttons that appear on the window
              manager title-bar.  The buttons are given as a list of
              button  names separated by comma, space or tab charac‐
              ters.  Valid button names are help, resize  and  hide.
              The default value is for all buttons to be displayed.

       defaultwidth or width
              Set  the  initial  window  width.  This option is only
              meaningful when running under the window manager.   If
              the  specified width exceeds the screen width then the
              screen width is used.  The default value is 630.

       defaultheight or height
              Set the initial height of the main display panel, this
              does  not  include  the  height  of  the  control  and
              progress panels.  This option is only meaningful  when
              running under the window manager.  If the total height
              of the charon window exceeds the  screen  height,  the
              main display panel height will be reduced to fit.  The
              default value is 450.

       x and/or y
              Set the initial window position.   These  options  are
              only meaningful when running under the window manager.
              The default value for both options is 0.

       imagelvl
              Specify how to handle image components of a  document.
              This  option  takes  a numeric argument.  A value of 0
              prevents images from being downloaded or displayed.  A
              value  of  1  will download and display images but not
              animate GIFS - only the first frame of an animated GIF
              will  be displayed.  A value of 2 or more enables full
              image processing.   The  default  value  enables  full
              image processing.

       imagecachenum
              Specify  the  maximum number of images that can remain
              resident in the image cache.  The default value is 60.

       imagecachemem
              Specify the maximum amount of image  memory  available
              to  the  image  cache  in bytes.  The cache is managed
              such that neither the imagecachenum nor  imagecachemem
              limits  are exceeded.  The image cache tries to ensure
              that no more than 80% of available system image memory
              is  taken  by  the cache, irrespective of the value of
              this option.  The default value is 80% of  the  system
              image  memory  that  was  available  when  charon  was
              started.

       docookies
              Enable cookie  handling.   A  non-zero  numeric  value
              enables  cookie handling, all other values disable it.
              The cookie cache is maintained in the cookies file  in
              the userdir directory.  The default value is 0, cookie
              handling disabled.

       doscripts
              Enable JavaScript support.  A non-zero  numeric  value
              enables  JavaScript, all other values disable it.  The
              default value is 0, JavaScript processing disabled.

       showprogress
              A non-zero numeric value results in the progress panel
              being  displayed.   All other values hide the progress
              panel, leaving more vertical space for the  main  dis‐
              play  area.   The  default  value  is  1,  causing the
              progress panel to be displayed

       http   Set the version of HTTP to use when communicating with
              web servers.  Supported versions are 1.0 and 1.1.  Any
              value other than 1.1 results in  HTTP1.0  being  used.
              The default value is 1.0.

       nthreads
              Specifies  the  maximum number of concurrent downloads
              of document components.  Generally, if this number  is
              higher,  pages will complete faster as charon will not
              have to wait for the download of one component to com‐
              plete  before another can be started.  The downside is
              that a higher number of concurrent downloads will  use
              more  memory during the download process.  The default
              value is 4.

FILES
       /services/config/charon.cfg
              The default configuration file.

       userdir/config
              The user  specific  configuration  file.   userdir  is
              given by the value of the userdir option.

       userdir/cookies
              The  cookie  cache.   userdir is given by the value of
              the userdir option.

       /services/webget/start.html
              The default start page.

       /services/webget/help.html
              The default help page.

SOURCE
       /appl/charon/
              The main charon source files.

       /appl/lib/ecmascript/
              Javascript (ECMA-262) implementation.

BUGS
       Charon has more than its fair share of real bugs.   The  fol‐
       lowing list documents the problems that are most likely to be
       encountered.

       Charon implements its  table  layout  as  per  the  algorithm
       described  in rfc1942.  This sometimes results in table-based
       documents being laid out differently to other browsers.

       JavaScript is a source of many problems.  Many scripts do not
       specify  the language version they employ.  Additionally dif‐
       ferent language versions and browsers imply a  different  set
       of  host  objects  and  classes.  Such differences often give
       rise to syntax or null reference errors.  This  whole  situa‐
       tion places a great burden on the script author to write safe
       and compliant scripts; unfortunately authors are rarely aware
       of this burden!

       The  following elements of JavaScript1.1 are not fully imple‐
       mented:

       Document.applets, Document.embeds and Document.plugins:  Java
       Applets are not supported, the arrays are always empty.

       Document.onunload:  The  property  exists and can be assigned
       to, but the event is never raised.

       Window.open(): A new window is never  opened.  If  a  URL  is
       specified  for  the  new window, the current document will be
       replaced with that of the new URL.

       Other annoyances include:

       Window resize forces a complete document reload.

       Frames in a frameset are processed one at a time, not concur‐
       rently.

       It  is not possible to save downloaded data to file.  This is
       particularly annoying for MIME types  that  charon  does  not
       support.

       The  history list can get confused, especially when following
       links in framesets before  the  complete  frameset  has  been
       downloaded.
