STYXMON(8)             System Manager's Manual            STYXMON(8)

NAME
       styxmon - monitor a 9P (Styx) conversation

SYNOPSIS
       styxmon [ -r ] [ -t ] cmd [ arg...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Styxmon  allows  the  monitoring  of  9P  messages  sent  and
       received by cmd, which should serve 9P through  its  standard
       input.   Styxmon  in  its turn serves 9P through its standard
       input, and writes information on the 9P messages that it sees
       to  the  standard  error.  The -r and -t options restrict the
       messages printed to R-messages and T-messages respectively.

EXAMPLE
       Mount an instance of export(4)  of  the  current  name  space
       through  styxmon  on  /n/remote  to  monitor all access to it
       through that name:

              mount {styxmon {export /}} /n/remote
              ls /n/remote
              cp /n/remote/lib/unicode /n/remote/dev/null
