GRID-MONITOR(1)        General Commands Manual       GRID-MONITOR(1)

NAME
       monitor - graphical display for viewing resource use.

SYNOPSIS
       command | grid/srv/monitor interface [ wintitle ]

DESCRIPTION
       Monitor  is  designed  to  work with resources that deal with
       incoming connections (such as grid-register(1))  to  visually
       display  the  connections  to a specific resource.  Interface
       sets the style of interface, this can be 1 or 2. Interface  1
       is the simplest, displaying only a list of connections to the
       resource. Interface 2  is  slightly  more  complex,  allowing
       extra  data to be displayed for each connection. While inter‐
       face 1 shows all the connections at any one time, interface 2
       displays a selection of 'slots' which have buttons that light
       up to signify a connection. Clicking on  a  lit  button  will
       display any data given about that connection in the main win‐
       dow.  Wintitle optionally sets the title of the monitor  win‐
       dow.   Command must write status messages to stdout which are
       then read and displayed (if appropriate) by monitor.  Monitor
       reads on stdin and accepts the following input:

   Interface 1
       add addr                      display   a   connection   from
                                     address addr

       del addr                      remove   a   connection    from
                                     address addr

   Interface 2
       data set id { data }          set and display the string data
                                     in slot id.

       data set id finished          clear slot id

   Common
       setup maxusers n              set display to fit a maximum of
                                     n   connections.  -1  signifies
                                     unlimited connections.

       starting pid                  add pid to a list of pids whose
                                     process  group  is to be killed
                                     if the user closes monitor.

       error errstr                  print  out  the  error   string
                                     errstr to the console.

       exit                          close down monitor and kill all
                                     processes in the current group.
