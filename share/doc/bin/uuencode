UUENCODE(1)            General Commands Manual           UUENCODE(1)

NAME
       uuencode, uudecode - encode/decode a file

SYNOPSIS
       uuencode [ sourcefile ] remotefile

       uudecode [ -p ] [ encodedfile ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Uuencode  and Uudecode are used to transmit files over trans‐
       mission mediums that do not support other than  simple  ASCII
       data.

       Uuencode  converts a file to a purely ASCII based representa‐
       tion. It encodes the contents of sourcefile or  the  standard
       input  if no source file is given. The remotefile is included
       in the encoded file's header  as the name of  the  file  into
       which uudecode should place the decoded data. The header also
       includes the permission modes of  the  source  file  so  that
       these   can  be  preserved on decoding. The encoded output of
       uuencode is sent to the standard output.

       Uudecode reads a file,  ignoring  any  leading  and  trailing
       lines  that  are  not part of the encoding, and recreates the
       original file with the filename and mode  specified  in  it's
       header.  The  file to decode is encodedfile or standard input
       if none is given. The -p flag can be used to send the decoded
       data  to  standard  output  rather than saving it in the file
       whose name is specified in the header.

EXAMPLES
       Encode a dis file limbo.dis so that it can be included  in  a
       mail message:

              uuencode limbo.dis limbo.dis > tmp
              <place in mail message and send to recipient>

       Decode the mail message(msg say):

              cat msg | uudecode

       This creates the file limbo.dis.

       Decode  the mail message into a file of your choosing(tmp.dis
       say):

              cat msg | uudecode -p > tmp.dis

SOURCE
       /appl/cmd/uuencode.b
       /appl/cmd/uudecode.b

BUGS
       The encoded file is expanded by at least a third.
       Decoding a file may overwrite an existing file.
       Uuencode should take the remote file name to be the  same  as
       the source file if one is not given.
