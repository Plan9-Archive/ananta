MUX(1)                 General Commands Manual                MUX(1)

NAME
       mux - interactive television demo

SYNOPSIS
       mux/mux

DESCRIPTION
       Mux  is  a  standalone  application  environment run from the
       Inferno console in emu(1) or started automatically by init(8)
       in a native environment.  It directly uses the draw(3) device
       and either keyboard or Infrared,  and  cannot  be  run  under
       wm(1).   It is included in this release only as an example of
       the use of the Prefab graphics module  described  by  prefab-
       intro(2).  The simpler style of graphics and interaction pro‐
       vided by Prefab and demonstrated by mux might be more  appro‐
       priate  than  Tk  on devices that use infrared remote control
       for interaction, such as televisions, or devices with limited
       screen space, such as pocket devices or portable telephones.

   Configuration
       Mux produces a menu derived from the configuration file /ser‐
       vices/basic.  Each line in the file has three  fields,  sepa‐
       rated by :, of the following form:

              icon:app:label

       The  icon  is  the  name of a bitmap file to displayed in the
       menu alongside the textual label (which is the  rest  of  the
       line).   When  the  item is selected, as described below, mux
       runs the Dis file

              /dis/mux/app.dis

   Applications
       The following applications are available:

       fnn    Financial reports: a scrolling `ticker tape' along the
              bottom of the screen.

   Interaction
       Mux  can  be  controlled  using  an  infrared device, but for
       demonstration purposes under emu(1) the infrared is  emulated
       using the keyboard (see ir(2)).  The following are the common
       controls:

       r      channel up

       c      channel down

       t      volume up

       v      volume down

       i      cursor up

       m      cursor down

       j      cursor left; rewind

       k      cursor right; fast forward

       x      return  to  main  menu  leaving  application  running;
              recall

       newline
              select item

       space  exit and return to the previous screen or menu
