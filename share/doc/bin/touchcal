TOUCHCAL(8)            System Manager's Manual           TOUCHCAL(8)

NAME
       touchcal - touch screen calibration

SYNOPSIS
       touchcal

DESCRIPTION
       Touchcal  draws  a cross-hair in each corner of the screen in
       turn (clockwise from the lower left hand corner),  and  waits
       each  time for the user to touch the centre of the cross-hair
       with the stylus.  It then prompts with a final cross-hair  in
       the centre of the screen, and waits once more for the user to
       touch its centre with the stylus.  The  process  is  repeated
       until  touchcal  can  calculate  a transformation matrix that
       consistently maps the touch panel to screen coordinates.   It
       then  writes  corresponding calibration commands for touch(3)
       on its standard output, which can be saved in a file  on  the
       device, perhaps provided in NVRAM by tinyfs(3) or a file sys‐
       tem in ftl(3).

       Touchcal can be used both inside and outside the wm(1)  envi‐
       ronment, allowing calibration when the system is initialised,
       and whilst the window system is running.
