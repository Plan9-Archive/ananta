REGEXP(6)                   Games Manual                   REGEXP(6)

NAME
       regexp, regex - regular expression notation

DESCRIPTION
       A  regular  expression  specifies a set of strings of charac‐
       ters.  A member of this set of strings is said to be  matched
       by  the regular expression.  In many applications a delimiter
       character, commonly bounds a regular expression.  In the fol‐
       lowing  specification for regular expressions the word `char‐
       acter' means any character (rune) but newline.

       The syntax for a regular expression e0 is

              e3:  literal | charclass | '.' | '^' | '$' | '(' e0 ')'

              e2:  e3
                |  e2 REP

              REP: '*' | '+' | '?'

              e1:  e2
                |  e1 e2

              e0:  e1
                |  e0 '|' e1

       A literal is any non-metacharacter, or a  metacharacter  (one
       of .*+?[]()|\^$), or the delimiter preceded by

       A  charclass  is a nonempty string s bracketed [s] (or [^s]);
       it matches any character in (or not in) s.  A negated charac‐
       ter class never matches newline.  A substring a-b, with a and
       b in ascending order, stands for the inclusive range of char‐
       acters  between a and b.  In s, the metacharacters an initial
       and the regular expression delimiter must be  preceded  by  a
       other  metacharacters  have no special meaning and may appear
       unescaped.

       A matches any character.

       A matches the beginning of a line; matches  the  end  of  the
       line.

       The  REP  operators  match zero or more (*), one or more (+),
       zero or one (?), instances respectively of the preceding reg‐
       ular expression e2.

       A  concatenated  regular expression, e1e2, matches a match to
       e1 followed by a match to e2.

       An alternative regular expression, e0|e1,  matches  either  a
       match to e0 or a match to e1.

       A match to any part of a regular expression extends as far as
       possible without preventing a match to the remainder  of  the
       regular expression.
