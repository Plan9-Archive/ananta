RCMD(1)                General Commands Manual               RCMD(1)

NAME
       rcmd - remote command execution

SYNOPSIS
       rcmd [ -e cryptoalg ] [ -x exportpath ] host [ cmd arg ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Rcmd  executes  cmd  on  the given host.  If no cmd is given,
       sh(1) is assumed.  The host must  have  enabled  the  service
       (typically started via svc(8)).

       For authentication, rcmd will use the certificate in the file

              /usr/username/keyring/net!machine

       if it exists, and otherwise it will use the certificate in

              /usr/username/keyring/default.

       The -e option sets the algorithm cryptoalg to be used follow‚Äê
       ing authentication for digesting or encryption.   See  ssl(3)
       for the supported algorithms.  The default is none: ssl(3) is
       not used after authentication.

       The -x option sets the path to be exported as root  from  the
       local machine (defaults to / if not specified).
