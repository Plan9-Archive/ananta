MINITERM(1)            General Commands Manual           MINITERM(1)

NAME
       miniterm - Minitel® emulator

SYNOPSIS
       wm/minitel/miniterm [ address ]

DESCRIPTION
       Miniterm  connects  to  the  Minitel®  service  at  the given
       address, by default the France Telecom  Internet  gateway  to
       its Minitel® service, tcp!pdc.minitelfr.com!513.  The address
       can be any form acceptable to dial(2).  Miniterm opens a  new
       window that mimics a Minitel display.  An array of buttons on
       the right hand side (in 40 character mode) or bottom  (in  80
       character  mode)  offer  the  special Minitel functions, with
       French abbreviations.  Characters typed on the  keyboard  are
       sent  to  the  server; typing the return key acts as Suite or
       Envoi as required.  Clicking on a word with the  mouse  sends
       it to the server.

       The  France  Telecom  gateway  offers a demonstration service
       using ID ZXNET1 with password DEMFTD.   Once  connected,  the
       services  PAGESM (a directory of all Minitel services) and FT
       (France Telecom's information service) are available  without
       charge.  See www.minitelfr.com for further information.

       On certain native Inferno hardware, miniterm can also connect
       directly via a modem connection, using an address of the form
       modem!modeminit!number,  which  sends the string modeminit to
       the modem to initialise it, then dials the given number.  For
       example:

              wm/minitel/miniterm modem!F3!00133836431414

       Here,  the  is  a  code  that tells the modem to enable V.23,
       which must be used when  connecting  to  the  France  Telecom
       servers.   To  use  pulse dialing instead of tone dialing the
       phone number can be prefixed with a as in:

              wm/minitel/miniterm modem!F3!P3614

       If the parameter specifies a network connection or  a  direct
       connection  with  a phone number the software will attempt to
       connect immediately.  If the on-screen button Cx/Fin is  used
       to disconnect and then re-connect, miniterm will use the same
       address if it is a network connection but prompt  for  a  new
       phone  number  for  a direct connection. When prompting for a
       new number the top row of the screen is  used  to  allow  the
       user  to  edit the last used number. Simple editing is avail‐
       able, and the minitel keys do the obvious things.

       The Minitel function keys are displayed  on  the  right  hand
       side  of the screen in 40 column mode on a network connection
       and can be swapped to the left hand side by hitting the  key.
       In  direct  dial mode and 80 column network mode the keys are
       displayed at the bottom of the screen.  In network mode  they
       are  redisplayed  as  appropriate  on  40  to  80 column mode
       changes.

       Miniterm provides  a  software  keyboard,  activated  by  the
       Clavier  button,  which  understands some of the Minitel key‐
       board mappings. For example, hitting `A' results in a capital
       on the screen in spite of the Videotex case mapping.

BUGS
       There  is  no  button  to  control use of error correction in
       direct dial mode; it will  be  enabled  only  if  the  server
       requests  it, but not all do.  Without it direct dial screens
       are occasionally corrupted.

       The software keyboard is not  AZERTY.   Worse,  it  does  not
       always come to the top on a mode change.

       Some screens look wrong in 80 column mode.

       On  a network connection, choosing USA displays at the bottom
       left hand corner of the screen. The server really is  sending
       this sequence.  Both the FT emulator and their explorer plug-
       in suffer from it too.
