FPGALOAD(8)            System Manager's Manual           FPGALOAD(8)

NAME
       fpgaload - configure FPGA

SYNOPSIS
       auxi/fpgaload [ -c clk ] file.rbf

DESCRIPTION
       Fpgaload  configures  the  directly-attached  Altera Flex6000
       FPGA on the Bright Star Engineering  ip-Engine.   It  enables
       the FPGA and output of the external system clocks, then loads
       the FPGA with the contents of file.rbf which should be in the
       `raw binary format' produced for example by the Altera tools.
       After successful configuration, the BCLK is set to  clk  MHz;
       clk  must  be a divisor of the ip-Engine's system clock (cur‚Äê
       rently 48 MHz).
