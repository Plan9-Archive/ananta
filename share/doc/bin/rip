NAME
       rip - routing information protocol

SYNOPSIS
       ip/rip [-2] [-b] [-d] [-n] [ -x mntpt ] [ net ...  ] &

DESCRIPTION
       Rip implements the Internet RIP routing protocol described by
       RFC1058 and RFC2453.  It watches the network and makes appro‐
       priate  changes  to the machine's Internet routing table (see
       iproute in ip(3)), based  on  routing  packets  broadcast  by
       gateways  on  the  network.   Rip  is only used when a single
       default gateway is inadequate, typically  because  a  machine
       sits  on a network directly connected to several others, hav‐
       ing no common gateway or router.  On networks where there  is
       just one gateway, it is usually simpler and more efficient to
       configure that statically using ndb(6) or  dynamically  using
       DHCP/BOOTP, rather than running rip.

       Rip  serves  the  network  on mntpt (default: /net).  When it
       starts, rip learns its own interfaces and  directly  attached
       networks  by  reading  mntpt/ipifc, and notes any routes cur‐
       rently in mntpt/iproute.

       By default, rip neither  broadcasts  routes  nor  replies  to
       requests for its route table.  If the -b option is given, rip
       periodically broadcasts changes to its routing table to  each
       of  its  interfaces.  If at least one explicit net address is
       given, the broadcasts are restricted to just  the  interfaces
       listed (and -b is implied).

       The -d option causes routed to record changes it makes to the
       routing tables.  This can be helpful when locating misleading
       announcements  from rogue gateways.  A second -d will include
       detailed information about every packet.  The -n option tells
       rip  not to change the local routing table, but only say what
       changes it would have made.

       Rip understands both version1 and version 2 of the  protocol,
       and  interprets  updates  from  gateways  appropriately.   By
       default, it transmits updates using  version  1;  if  the  -2
       option  is given, it uses version 2 instead, which is prefer‐
       able when the network has subnets.
