NAME
       prof, wm/prof - profiling limbo programs

SYNOPSIS
       prof [ -bflnve ] [ -m modname ] ... [ -s rate ] [ cmd arg ...
       ]

       wm/prof [ -e ] [ -m modname ] ... [ -s rate ] [ cmd  arg  ...
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       Prof is a simple profiling tool which calculates the percent‐
       age of time spent on a particular line  of  limbo  source  or
       spent  in a particular limbo function. It can determine where
       a module or set of modules is spending its time.  The  source
       in  question  should be compiled with the -g flag so that the
       relevant symbol table files exist.

       The tk version of the profiler wm/prof shows this information
       in a text widget and colours the lines of source according to
       the amount of time spent on each line. The darker the colour,
       the longer spent.

       The -b option starts profiling.

       The -f option shows the function profile.

       The  -l option shows the line profile. If neither this option
       nor the -f option are given, -l is assumed.

       The -n option lists the name of the file along with the  line
       number.

       The  -v  option  outputs all functions and/or lines even when
       the percentage of time spent in them is zero.

       The -m option lists the module names which  are  to  be  pro‐
       filed.  If none are given, all the modules loaded by the ker‐
       nel will be profiled. The name may be the actual name of  the
       module or its path name.

       The -e option profiles the module that is loaded first in any
       following command. In this case there is no need to give a -m
       option as this is added automatically.

       The  -s option sets the sample interval rate and is expressed
       in ms. The default is 100 ms.

       Any remaining arguments are assumed to specify a command  and
       set  of  arguments  to the command. If this is the case, prof
       will automatically start profiling, run the command  to  com‐
       pletion  and  then  stop profiling before showing the profile
       statistics.

       Prof displays the profile statistics (unless the -b option is
       being used) according to the output format required.

EXAMPLE
       To profile a particular command
            prof /dis/math/parts 10000
            wm/prof /dis/math/parts 10000
       To profile the same command but restrict attention to its own module (Partitions).
            prof -m Partitions /dis/math/parts 10000
            wm/prof -m Partitions /dis/math/parts 10000
       A shorter version of the above
            prof -e /dis/math/parts 10000
            wm/prof -e /dis/math/parts 10000
       To profile interactively
            prof -b -m Partitions -s 10
            /dis/math/parts 10000
            prof -f -l -n

       Note that the output format options ( -f , -l , -n , -v ) are
       ignored when -b is present.
