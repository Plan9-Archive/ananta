PS(1)                  General Commands Manual                 PS(1)

NAME
       ps - process (thread) status

SYNOPSIS
       bind '#p' /prog

       ps

DESCRIPTION
       Ps  prints  to the standard output information about all cur‚Äê
       rent Inferno processes.  It looks in /prog for process status
       files;  normally  that  requires  that the prog(3) device has
       previously been bound there (as shown above), but it is  also
       possible to import /prog from a remote machine.

       Each  line  of information printed consists of seven columns:
       the process id, the  process  group  id,  the  owner  of  the
       process,  cpu  time used by the process, the run state of the
       process, the amount of memory used by the  process,  and  the
       name of the module containing the currently running function.

FILES
       /prog/*/status

SOURCE
       /appl/cmd/ps.b

SEE ALSO
       deb(1),  kill(1),  stack(1),  wm/task  and  wm/memory  in wm-
       misc(1), prog(3)

BUGS
       The amount reported as ``memory used''  does  not  accurately
       reflect  the  amount  of  memory  referred to by the process,
       because the heap is shared.
       The cpu time used is currently shown as zero in  most  hosted
       implementations.
