SH-MLOAD(1)            General Commands Manual           SH-MLOAD(1)

NAME
       mload, munload - namespace separation for shell modules

SYNOPSIS
       load mload

       mload name [ path...  ]
       munload name [ path...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mload is a loadable module for sh(1) that allows the simulta‐
       neous use of shell modules with potentially clashing  command
       name  spaces.   Mload  creates a new namespace name and loads
       each path as a builtin module in the same way  as  load  (see
       sh(1)).  Any commands or substitution builtins defined by the
       modules are accessible by giving the command  and  its  argu‐
       ments as arguments to the name command.

       Munload unloads a module from the namespace name.  If no mod‐
       ules remain in the namespace, name is undefined as a command.

EXAMPLE
       Load mpexpr in a  different  namespace  from  expr  (see  sh-
       expr(1)):
       load expr
       mload mp mpexpr
       echo ${expr 1 2 +}
       echo ${mp expr 2 300 xx}

BUGS
       Because  of the way shell modules are implemented, the names‐
       paces are global across all processes that share an  instance
       of mload.
