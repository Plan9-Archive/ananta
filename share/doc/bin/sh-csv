NAME
       csv, getcsv - parse ``comma-separated values''

SYNOPSIS
       load csv

       getcsv command
       ${csv list}

DESCRIPTION
       Csv is a loadable module for sh(1) that provides the facility
       to parse and  generate  ``comma-separated  value''  lists,  a
       widely  used  data  exchange  format.  Data in this format is
       usually in the form of a table, each row  of  which  contains
       one or more items, each separated by a comma (,).  Items that
       contain a comma or a  newline  are  surrounded  with  double-
       quotes  (").  A double-quote within an item is represented by
       a pair of double-quotes.  Two primitives are provided:

       getcsv    Getcsv works similiarly to getlines  in  sh-std(1).
                 It  reads  from  the  standard input, and for every
                 line read, invokes command with $line  set  to  the
                 items  found  on  that line (one element per item).
                 Getcsv recognises the usual loop break and continue
                 exceptions.

       ${csv}    Csv  yields  a  single  element  containing all the
                 items in list, comma-separated and quoted as neces‐
                 sary.

BUGS
       Empty  lines  are ambiguous: csv treats an empty line as con‐
       taining a single, empty element; there is thus no way of rep‐
       resenting a line containing no elements at all.
