NAME
       vacget, vacput - venti archive utilities

SYNOPSIS
       vacget [ -vdpt ] [ -a addr ] vac:score
       vacput  [ -vd ] [ -i | -x ] [ -a addr ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -n
       name ] [ -u uid ] [ -g gid ] path ...

DESCRIPTION
       Vacget retrieves a venti archive from a venti server  to  the
       current working directory.

       Vacput  writes  a venti archive to a venti server.  The paths
       are walked recursively and all files and directories  written
       to  the  archive.  Temporary files, i.e. those with the DMTMP
       bit set, are skipped.  Writing only changed files relative to
       a previously written archive is not implemented.

       -d     Print debug messages.

       -p     Try  to  preserve  file  permissions  and owner/group.
              Only for vacget.

       -v     Be verbose.  Prints files as they are being  retrieved
              or written.

       -t     List files, do not write them.  Only for vacget.

       -a address
              Dial address instead of the default venti server.

       -b blocksize
              Use blocks with blocksize bytes instead of the default
              8192 byte blocks.  Only for vacput.

       -n name
              Use name as the name in  the  root  block.   Only  for
              vacput.

       -i or -x
              Read  a  list  of  files from stdin to include (-i) or
              exclude (-x) from the (recursively walked) paths spec‚Äê
              ified on the command-line.  Only for vacput.
