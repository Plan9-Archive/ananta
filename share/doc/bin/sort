SORT(1)                General Commands Manual               SORT(1)

NAME
       sort - sort file

SYNOPSIS
       sort [ -nr ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sort  sorts  the  lines of file (default: standard input) and
       writes the sorted output to standard output.

       Whole lines are sorted into increasing order,  using  lexico‚Äê
       graphic  ordering of Unicode characters by default.  The sort
       is stable, so that lines that compare equal  will  appear  in
       the  output  in  the same order as in the original file.  The
       sort order is affected by the following options:

       -n     Each line is assumed to have an initial numeric string
              representing  an  integer, with optional plus or minus
              sign, and the lines are sorted by those numeric values
              into increasing order.

       -r     Reverses the sense of comparisons.

BUGS
       The entire file is read into memory to be sorted.

                                                             SORT(1)
