FREQ(1)                General Commands Manual               FREQ(1)

NAME
       freq - print histogram of character frequencies

SYNOPSIS
       freq [ -dxocr ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Freq  reads  the  given  files  (default  standard input) and
       prints histograms of the character frequencies.  By  default,
       freq  counts  the  value of each byte; under the -r option it
       instead counts UTF byte sequences, that is, runes.

       Each non-zero entry of the table is printed preceded  by  the
       byte value, in decimal, octal, hex, and Unicode character (if
       printable).  If any options are given, the  -d,  -x,  -o,  -c
       flags specify a subset of value formats: decimal, hex, octal,
       and character, respectively.
