SPREE-JOIN(1)          General Commands Manual         SPREE-JOIN(1)

NAME
       join - join a spree clique.

SYNOPSIS
       spree/join [ -d mntdir ] [ -j joinrequest ] name

DESCRIPTION
       When  a  spree(4) instance has been mounted from somewhere on
       the network, join can be used to join a clique  and  fire  up
       the  appropriate  module  to perform the client-side display.
       Mntdir gives  the  directory  where  the  spree  instance  is
       mounted  (default  /n/remote);  joinrequest gives the initial
       join request to be passed to the clique (default join).  Name
       is the name of the clique's directory within the spree direc‚Äê
       tory.

EXAMPLE
       When spree is started, it creates  a  ``lobby''  engine  that
       keeps  a  record  of what cliques have been started, who is a
       member of which, etc.
            spree/join 0
       will connect to this session.
