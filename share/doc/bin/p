NAME
       p - paginate

SYNOPSIS
       p [ -number ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       P  copies its standard input, or the named files if given, to
       its standard output, stopping at the end of  every  page,  to
       wait for a newline from the user.  The option sets the number
       of lines on a page (default: 22).

       While waiting for a newline, p interprets the commands:

       !      Pass the rest of the line to the shell as a command.

       q      Quit.
