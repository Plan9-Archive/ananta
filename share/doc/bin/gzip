GZIP(1)                General Commands Manual               GZIP(1)

NAME
       gzip, gunzip - compression and decompression utilities

SYNOPSIS
       gzip [ -v ] [ -level ] [ file...  ]
       gunzip [ file...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Gzip  and  gunzip  perform data compression and decompression
       compatible with the Unix  gzip  file  format,  which  uses  a
       hybrid  Lempel-Ziv  1977  and  Huffman  compression algorithm
       called `deflate'.  If no arguments are given gzip  compresses
       each  file replacing it by a file of the same name with the a
       .gz suffix appended.  If no files are given,  standard  input
       and  standard  output  are  used.   Level is a single decimal
       digit between 1 and 9; higher numbers  give  better  compres‚Äê
       sion.   The default level is 6.  The -v option causes gzip to
       report the compression ratio of each file that it compresses.

       Gunzip performs the opposite operation  to  gzip;  each  file
       (which  must have a .gz suffix) is uncompressed, and replaced
       by a file of the same name with the .gz suffix removed. If no
       files are given, standard input and standard output are used.
