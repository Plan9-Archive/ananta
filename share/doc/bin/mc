MC(1)                  General Commands Manual                 MC(1)

NAME
       mc - multicolumn print

SYNOPSIS
       mc [ -c columns ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mc  formats the contents of files (standard input by default)
       into columns.  Columns is an integer specifying the number of
       character widths into which mc's output is formatted.  If run
       in an acme(1) window, the default columns is  the  number  of
       zeros  that will fit across the window; otherwise the default
       columns is 65.

BUGS
       The columns are not aligned properly if  the  input  contains
       tabs.
       The  output  doesn't  fit  the  width of a wm-sh(1) window by
       default.
