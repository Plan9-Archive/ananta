NAME
       pwd - print working directory

SYNOPSIS
       pwd

DESCRIPTION
       Pwd  prints the path name of the working (current) directory.
       It is guaranteed to return the same path  that  was  used  to
       enter  the  directory.  Note that if meanwhile the name space
       has changed, or directories in the path  have  been  renamed,
       the path name may no longer be valid.
