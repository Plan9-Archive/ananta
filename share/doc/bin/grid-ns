GRID-NS(1)             General Commands Manual            GRID-NS(1)

NAME
       grid:  ns  -  exports  a  selected namespace and serves it on
       standard input

SYNOPSIS
       grid/srv/ns    [ -r relpath ] path1 path2...path n
       grid/runns     [ -r relpath ] path1 path2...path n

DESCRIPTION
       Ns exports a selected subsection of the local  namespace  and
       serves  it on stdin.  The path arguments specify which direc‐
       tories are to be exported.  If  subdirectories  are  exported
       without  their parents, ns attempts to maintain the namespace
       structure by creating the parents but  populating  them  only
       with  the  selected  subdirectories.  For  example, exporting
       /appl/lib would mean that the exported /appl  directory  con‐
       tained nothing apart from the lib subdirectory. If relpath is
       specified, all paths will be viewed relative  to  this  path.
       For    instance,    if    relpath   is   /usr/inferno,   then
       /usr/inferno/bin/dis would be listed  as  /bin/dis  and  /tmp
       would not be listed at all.

       Grid-register(1) may be used in conjunction with ns to regis‐
       ter it with a registry(4) and to export and serve its  names‐
       pace across dial(2) network connections. Incoming connections
       may also be displayed visually  using  grid-monitor(1).   For
       example:

       grid/register  [  options  ...  ]  { grid/srv/ns paths... } |
       grid/srv/monitor 1 'NS resource'

       This set of commands is encapsulated within the shell  script
       runns which will automatically register ns with a registry(4)
       if possible and start up the graphical display to  show  con‐
       nections  to  the  resource. There is no need for the user to
       execute ns outside of runns unless the namespace it  provides
       is  required to be accessible in a different way to that pro‐
       vided by grid-register(1).
