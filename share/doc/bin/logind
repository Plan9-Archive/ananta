LOGIND(8)              System Manager's Manual             LOGIND(8)

NAME
       logind - login daemon

SYNOPSIS
       auth/logind

DESCRIPTION
       Logind  is  normally started by svc(8) to service requests on
       the inflogin TCP/IP port,  to  provide  a  `signing'  service
       (identity  authentication)  for  a  network.  Ultimately, the
       client receives a certificate that can be used  to  establish
       its identity with any host that is willing to honour certifi‚Äê
       cates from the certificate's signer.

       The signer constructs the certificate from  the  contents  of
       the  signer's key file /keydb/signerkey, typically created by
       createsignerkey(8), and the ID string and  password  supplied
       by  the  client  (which  are used to access keyfs(4) to check
       identity).

       The protocol involves an exchange of information between  the
       client  and  server,  as  summarised in login(6).  The client
       side of this exchange can be managed by the Login module; see
       security-login(2).

       Client  and  server  communicate over the Secure Socket Layer
       device ssl(3).
