CHGRP(1)               General Commands Manual              CHGRP(1)

NAME
       chgrp - change file's group or owner

SYNOPSIS
       chgrp [ -uo ] id file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Chgrp  changes  the group ownership of each file to the given
       id, if the file's server permits it.  The -u and  -o  options
       are  equivalent  and  cause  chgrp  to  change file ownership
       instead, if the file's server permits it.

       Normally, a file's group can be changed by the file's  owner,
       if  the  owner is a member of the new group, or by the leader
       of both the file's current group and the new group, but vari‐
       ous  underlying devices, file servers and host operating sys‐
       tems might not permit the operation at all.  Group and owner‐
       ship  changes allowed by a given device are documented by the
       device's manual page.  See  sys-stat(2)  for  the  variations
       amongst host operating systems.
