GETTAR(1)              General Commands Manual             GETTAR(1)

NAME
       gettar, lstar, puttar - tar archive utilities

SYNOPSIS
       gettar [ -k ] [ -v ] [ -R ] [ name ...  ]
       lstar
       puttar [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       These commands manage POSIX.1 tar archives in Inferno.

       Gettar  reads  a tar file from standard input and unpacks the
       contents into the current directory tree.  By default, gettar
       converts  absolute  path names, including names starting with
       into names relative to the current directory; the  -R  option
       extracts  such  names  as-is.   The -k option tells gettar to
       keep existing files rather than overwriting them  with  files
       from  the  archive.   The -v option causes gettar to print on
       standard error the names of files extracted.  Finally,  list‐
       ing  one  or  more names as arguments will extract only those
       files.

       Lstar reads a tar file from  standard  input  and  lists  the
       files  contained therein, one per line, with four space-sepa‐
       rated fields giving the file name, modification time (in sec‐
       onds since the epoch), size (in bytes), and a constant 0 (the
       place holder for a checksum).  The format is the same as that
       produced by du -n -t.

       Puttar  writes  a  tar  file to standard output that contains
       each file, and its substructure if it is a directory.   Given
       no  arguments, puttar instead reads a list of file names from
       standard input and includes each file or directory named;  it
       does not copy directory substructure.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  commands  create  a  tar  file with two files
       test.b and srv.b:

              $ cat tarlist
              test.b
              srv.b
              $ puttar <tarlist >test.tar
              $ lstar <test.tar
              test.b 867178082 1104 0
              srv.b 866042662 3865 0
