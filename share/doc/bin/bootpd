BOOTPD(8)              System Manager's Manual             BOOTPD(8)

NAME
       bootpd, tftpd - Internet booting

SYNOPSIS
       ip/bootpd [ -dsq ] [ -f dbfile ] [ -x network ]

       ip/tftpd [-dr] [ -p port ] [ -h homedir ] [ -x network ]

DESCRIPTION
       Bootpd  listens  for Internet BOOTP requests and broadcasts a
       suitable reply to each request that matches an entry  in  the
       network database dbfile (default: /lib/ndb/local).  The BOOTP
       protocol is typically used by a remote system as it boots, to
       obtain its Internet address and other configuration data such
       as the addresses of servers (see for instance the bootp  file
       in ip(3)).

       Dbfile  is  in  ndb(6)  format,  as interpreted by attrdb(2).
       Bootpd uses the following attributes:

       auth   authentication server name or address

       bootf  name of the client's boot file

       dom    fully-qualified domain name

       ether  hardware (MAC) address; only Ethernet is supported

       fs     file server name or address

       ip     client's Internet address

       ipgw   gateway from client's subnet (IP address)

       ipmask subnet mask

       ipnet  network name

       sys    system name (client identifier)

       Bootpd replies to an incoming request only  if  its  hardware
       address  matches the value of the ether attribute of an entry
       in dbfile .  If found,  the  reply  contains  all  the  other
       requested  data that is contained in the entry; if an item is
       missing, it is sought in the entries for successively  higher
       networks  (described  by  ipnet  entries)  that  contain  the
       requesting system's address.  The `vendor specific'  part  of
       the  reply  conveys the file server and authentication server
       addresses to Inferno clients.  Before  answering  a  request,
       bootpd rereads dbfile if it has changed since last read.

       The  -s  option  causes bootpd to sniff the network for BOOTP
       traffic and print it, but not reply.  The  -d  option  prints
       debugging information; giving it twice prints even more.  The
       -x option tells bootpd to use  a  network  other  than  /net.
       Currently  bootpd  prints  a  message to standard output each
       time it replies; the -q option keeps it quiet.

       Tftpd is mainly used to send kernels and configuration  files
       to  machines booting from the network.  It listens for incom‚Äê
       ing TFTP  file  transfer  requests  on  the  given  UDP  port
       (default:  69) and responds by sending or receiving a file as
       requested.  Homedir is the current directory  for  transfers,
       /services/tftpd  by default, and requests that use a relative
       path name refer to files in or below that directory.  If  the
       -r  option  is given, absolute path names are also restricted
       to homedir.  Tftpd runs as none (the least  privileged  user)
       and  can  send  only  files  with general read permission, or
       write files that are generally writable.  Normally tftpd uses
       the network directory /net, but another can be specified with
       the -x option.  The -d option prints  a  debugging  trace  on
       standard output.
