FC(1)                  General Commands Manual                 FC(1)

NAME
       fc - command-line floating point calculator

SYNOPSIS
       fc [ base ] expression

DESCRIPTION
       Fc  calculates  the  result  of  its  argument expression and
       prints the result in the format  indicated  by  the  optional
       base argument.  Base can be one of:

       -d     Decimal, as produced by the %g format of sys-print(2).

       -x     Hexadecimal, prefixed with 0x.

       -o     Octal, prefixed with 0.

       -b     Binary, prefixed with 0b.

       -B     As -b, but with extra lines to help bit-counting.

       -r radix
              In base radix, prefixed with ``radixr'', as understood
              by Limbo (e.g.  16r3fff).

       -c     As a unicode character, prefixed with @.

       Expression is in reverse polish notation: each  command  line
       argument is either an operand (number) or an operator.  Oper‐
       ands are pushed on a stack;  operators  pop  items  from  the
       stack  (the number of items depends on the operator) and push
       their result. All operands are converted to double  precision
       floating  point  numbers before being pushed.  Integer opera‐
       tions convert their operands to big (64-bit) integers.   When
       all  arguments are exhausted, all the values currently on the
       stack are printed, first-pushed first, in the specified  out‐
       put format.

       Operands  can  be  given  in  any  of the formats that fc can
       print, as detailed above.

       When an operation is not  commutative,  the  argument  values
       will  be taken from the stack first-pushed first.  Most func‐
       tions from from math-elem(2), math-fp(2)  are  provided.   In
       addition, other provided operators include:

       + - / x
              Representing  the four rules. Note the use of x rather
              than *, to avoid clashes with shell metacharacters.

       xx     To the power. (equivelant to 'pow')

       rad deg
              Convert value to or from radians.

       !      Factorial.

       _      Unary minus.

       and or xor not
              Bitwise operations.

       shl shr
              Bitwise shift left/right.

       p      Print the current top value on the stack.

       sum    Sum all the values currently pushed on the stack.

       swap   Swap the top two stack items.

       dup    Duplicate the top item on the stack.

       rep    Repeatedly execute the last operator  until  there  is
              only  only  one  item left on the stack.  This is only
              valid for operators that take exactly two arguments.

       A few symbolic names for operands are  recognised,  including
       pi (or π), e, and macheps.

EXAMPLES
       fc 22 7 /

            gives 3.1428571429

       fc -b 1 2 3 4 sum

            gives 0b00001010

       fc 10 0b10 010 0x10 x rep 0xa00 swap -

            gives 0

       fc -help

            gives a usage summary, including a list of
            the names of all the operators.

DIAGNOSTICS
       An  error  message is displayed if an operator is called on a
       stack with too few elements. This also causes fc to  yield  a
       non-null exit status.

BUGS
       The -B option will only work for fixed-width fonts.
