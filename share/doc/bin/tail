TAIL(1)                General Commands Manual               TAIL(1)

NAME
       tail - deliver the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS
       tail [ [+-]number[lbc][rf] ] [ file ]

       tail [ -fr ] [ -n nlines ] [ -c ncharacters ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tail  copies  the named file to the standard output beginning
       at a designated place.  If no file  is  named,  the  standard
       input is copied.

       Copying  begins  at position +number measured from the begin‐
       ning, or -number from  the  end  of  the  input.   Number  is
       counted  in  lines, 1K blocks or characters, according to the
       appended flag or Default is -10l (ten ell).

       The further flag causes tail to print lines from the  end  of
       the file in reverse order; (follow) causes tail, after print‐
       ing to the end, to keep watch and print further  data  as  it
       appears.

       The  second  syntax  is  that promulgated by POSIX, where the
       numbers of lines (-n) or characters (-c) are specified  sepa‐
       rately  as  signed  integers.  Note than an unsigned value is
       treated as negative, ie '-n 2' is equivalent to '-n -2'.

EXAMPLES
       tail file
              Print the last 10 lines of a file.

       tail +0f file
              Print a file, and continue to watch data accumulate as
              it grows.
              According  to custom, option +number counts lines from
              1, and counts blocks and characters from 0.

       tail -nlines +3 file
              Print a file starting at line number 3

                                                             TAIL(1)
