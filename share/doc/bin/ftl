FTL(8)                 System Manager's Manual                FTL(8)

NAME
       ftl - Flash Translation Layer formatter

SYNOPSIS
       disk/ftl flashsize secsize kfsfile output

DESCRIPTION
       Ftl  reads  a file system image in kfs(3) format from kfsfile
       and adds the data structures needed to make it a valid  image
       for the Flash Translation Layer driver ftl(3).  The result is
       written to the output file, which can be copied to initialise
       the flash memory of a suitable device (see flash(3)).

       The other arguments describe the characteristics of the flash
       memory:

       flashsize
              The size in bytes of the flash memory to which  output
              will  be copied; exactly flashsize bytes will be writ‚Äê
              ten to output.

       secsize
              The effective erase unit (sector) size in bytes of the
              flash memory, as seen by the processor, having allowed
              for bus width.  For example, a bank  of  flash  formed
              from byte-wide flash chips, each with 16kbyte sectors,
              wired across a 4 byte bus,  might  have  an  effective
              erase unit size of 64kbytes.

       The  kfsfile must not be larger than the size (length) of the
       ftldata file provided by ftl(3) for the target  flash  device
       or partition.  (That size is invariably less than the size of
       the raw flash, owing to the overhead of FTL  data  structures
       and  a  reserve  pool  of  5%  to  reduce the number of erase
       cycles; see ftl(3)).
