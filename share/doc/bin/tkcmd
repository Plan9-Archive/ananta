TKCMD(1)               General Commands Manual              TKCMD(1)

NAME
       tkcmd - enter Tk commands interactively

SYNOPSIS
       tkcmd [ -iu ] [ tkarg ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tkcmd  allows  interactive entry of Tk commands; it is useful
       for testing out features of Tk prior to incorporating them in
       a Limbo program. It accepts two arguments:

       -i     Force  interactive  mode.  In  interactive  mode  (the
              default  if  the  standard  input   is   directed   at
              /dev/cons),  a  prompt is printed before every tk com‐
              mand entered.

       -u     Suppress the automatic tk update command  after  every
              entered command.

       When  tkcmd  is  started,  a new top level window is created;
       tkcmd creates a titlebar and handles all  the  normal  window
       window  manager  interactions.   When  the  window is closed,
       tkcmd  terminates.   Each  line  typed  to  tkcmd  is  passed
       directly  to the function Tk->cmd (see tk(2)) and executed in
       the context of the top level window; a Tk ``update''  command
       is  then  issued.   Any  return  value  from  the  command is
       printed.  There is one predefined Tk  channel,  named  ``std‐
       out''; anything sent down this channel will be printed to the
       standard output.
