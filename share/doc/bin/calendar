CALENDAR(1)            General Commands Manual           CALENDAR(1)

NAME
       calendar - calendar and diary

SYNOPSIS
       wm/calendar [ mntdir|datafile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Calendar  is  a  simple  calendar  and  diary  program.   Its
       optional argument specifies either a directory on  which  has
       been mounted a rawdbfs (see dbfs(4)) filesystem, or a file in
       which to store schedule entries (which must  already  exist).
       In the latter case, calendar starts up an instance of rawdbfs
       to serve the  file.  The  default  argument  to  calendar  is
       /mnt/schedule.   If  two  instances of calendar are using the
       same datafile, care should be taken  to  run  rawdbfs  before
       running  the  calendar programs, otherwise the data file will
       be corrupted.

EXAMPLE
       Start calendar using $home/cal for the data entries:
            rawdbfs $home/cal /mnt/schedule
            wm/calendar
