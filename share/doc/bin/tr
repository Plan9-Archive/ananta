TR(1)                  General Commands Manual                 TR(1)

NAME
       tr - translate characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [ -cds ] [ string1 [ string2 ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tr copies the standard input to the standard output with sub‐
       stitution or deletion of selected characters (runes).   Input
       characters found in string1 are mapped into the corresponding
       characters of string2.  When string2 is short it is padded to
       the length of string1 by duplicating its last character.  Any
       combination of the options -cds may be used:

       -c     Complement string1: replace it  with  a  lexicographi‐
              cally ordered list of all other characters.

       -d     Delete from input all characters in string1.

       -s     Squeeze  repeated  output  characters  that  occur  in
              string2 to single characters.

       In either string a noninitial sequence -x,  where  x  is  any
       character  (possibly  quoted),  stands for a range of charac‐
       ters: a possibly empty sequence of  codes  running  from  the
       successor  of  the  previous  code up through the code for x.
       The character followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits  stands  for
       the  character  whose  16-bit value is given by those digits.
       The character sequence followed by 1 to 6 hexadecimal  digits
       stands for the character whose 21-bit value is given by those
       digits.  A followed by any other character  stands  for  that
       character.

EXAMPLES
       Replace all upper-case ASCII letters by lower-case.

              tr A-Z a-z <mixed >lower

       Create  a  list  of  all the words in one per line in where a
       word is taken to be a maximal string of alphabetics.  String2
       is given as a quoted newline.

              tr -cs A-Za-z '
              ' <file1 >file2
