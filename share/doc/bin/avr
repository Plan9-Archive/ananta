AVR(1)                 General Commands Manual                AVR(1)

NAME
       avr - Atmel AVR support

SYNOPSIS
       avr/burn [-e] [-r] [ -d device ] file.srec

DESCRIPTION
       Currently  there  is  just one Inferno application to support
       Atmel AVRs but others should appear.

       Burn  initialises  or  verifies  the  contents  of  an  Atmel
       ATmega128  AVR.  The programming board must be connected to a
       serial port (see eia(3)), /dev/eia0 by default.  File.srec is
       a  file  containing the desired flash contents in Motorola S-
       record format, as produced by ms2(10.1).   By  default,  burn
       erases  the  AVR chip (both flash and EEPROM), then loads the
       flash with the contents of file.srec.  The  -e  option  stops
       burn  from erasing first, allowing additional code or data to
       be loaded (but only into an already-erased region).   If  the
       -r option is given, burn instead compares the contents of the
       AVR with the data in file.srec.   Burn  supports  the  MIB510
       programming board from Crossbow Technology Inc.
