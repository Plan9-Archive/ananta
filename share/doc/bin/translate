TRANSLATE(6)                Games Manual                TRANSLATE(6)

NAME
       translate - translation dictionary

SYNOPSIS
       /locale/dict/app
       /locale/locale/dict/app

DESCRIPTION
       A dictionary file provides translation text that applications
       can access using translate(2).  Each is a Unicode  file  con‐
       taining a set of translations, one per line, each line having
       the following syntax:

              "source-text" [ (note-text) ] [ ="target-text"  ]

       which defines target-text as the translation for  source-text
       .  A missing translation clause defines the identity transla‐
       tion.  The optional note-text qualifies the  context  of  the
       source-text,  when  the  same  phrase  in the source language
       might translate to different phrases in the target  language,
       or  to  distinguish  a particular context in the program (eg,
       particular menus): For example:

              "Times"(newspaper) = "La Republicca"
              "Times"(timetable) = "L'orario"
              "ABC"(keypad) = "abc"

       Empty lines and lines beginning  with  #  are  ignored.   The
       quoted  strings  can  contain  the  Limbo escape sequences \n
       (newline), \t (tab), \r  (carriage  return),  and  \\  (back‐
       slash).

       The  default  locale  is  set by binding one or more specific
       locales onto /locale/dict.
