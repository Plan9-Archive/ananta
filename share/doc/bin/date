DATE(1)                General Commands Manual               DATE(1)

NAME
       date - print the date

SYNOPSIS
       date [ -u ] [ -n ] [ seconds ]

DESCRIPTION
       Prints the date to standard output, in the format:

              Wed Jan 12 11:54:06 GMT 2002

       The options are

       -u     Report  Greenwich  Mean  Time  (GMT) rather than local
              time.

       -n     Report the date as the number  of  seconds  since  the
              epoch, 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.

       Current  time  is obtained by reading /dev/time.  The conver‚Äê
       sion from Greenwich Mean Time to local time  depends  on  the
       contents of /locale/timezone.

       If  the  optional  argument seconds is present, it is used as
       the time to convert rather than the real time.
