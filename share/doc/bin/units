NAME
       units - conversion program

SYNOPSIS
       units [ -v ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Units  converts  quantities  expressed  in  various  standard
       scales to their equivalents in other scales.  It works inter‐
       actively in this fashion:

              you have: inch
              you want: cm
                  * 2.54
                   / 0.3937008

       A  quantity  is  specified as a multiplicative combination of
       units and floating point numbers.  Operators have the follow‐
       ing precedence:

              + -            add and subtract
              * / × ÷        multiply and divide
              catenation     multiply
              ² ³ ^          exponentiation
              |              divide
              ( ... )        grouping

       Most  familiar  units, abbreviations, and metric prefixes are
       recognized, together with a generous leavening of exotica and
       a few constants of nature including:

              pi,π    ratio of circumference to diameter
              c       speed of light
              e       charge on an electron
              g       acceleration of gravity
              force   same as g
              mole    Avogadro's number
              water   pressure head per unit height of water
              au      astronomical unit

       The is a unit of mass.  Compound names are run together, e.g.
       British units that differ from their US counterparts are pre‐
       fixed thus: Currency is denoted etc.

       The  complete  list  of  units can be found in /lib/units.  A
       file argument to units specifies a file to be used instead of
       /lib/units.   The  -v  flag  causes units to print its entire
       database.

EXAMPLE
       you have: 15 pounds force/in²
       you want: atm
               * 1.020689
               / 0.9797299

BUGS
       Since units does only multiplicative scale  changes,  it  can
       convert  Kelvin  to Rankine but not Centigrade to Fahrenheit,
       except that the latter is handled as a special case.
       Currency conversions are only as accurate as  the  last  time
       someone updated /lib/units.
