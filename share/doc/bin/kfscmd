NAME
       kfscmd - kfs administration

SYNOPSIS
       disk/kfscmd [-n name] cmd ...

DESCRIPTION
       Kfscmd  issues  commands  to a kfs(4) server that was started
       with the -n option to create a control file.  Kfscmd's own -n
       option  names the file system to which the cmd applies; it is
       main by default.

       The known commands are described below.  Note that some  com‐
       mands are multiple words (eg, check and its flags) and should
       be quoted to appear as a single argument to sh(1).

                 tration).   Equivalent  to the -P and -W options to
