NAME
       wc - count lines, words, and characters

SYNOPSIS
       wc [ -lwceb ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Wc  writes  to  standard  output a tally of lines, words, and
       characters found in each file, assumed to be text in UTF for‐
       mat.  If no files are named, standard input is read. One line
       is output per file. If several files are specified, an  addi‐
       tional line is written giving totals.

       `Words'  are  maximal  sequences  of  characters separated by
       blanks, tabs and newlines.

       Counts are output in the same order as  the  listing  of  the
       option  letters  lwceb;  select lines, words, UTF characters,
       erroneously-encoded characters, and bytes, respectively.   If
       no  options  are  given,  lines,  words  and  characters  are
       counted.
