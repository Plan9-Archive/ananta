VIRGILD(8)             System Manager's Manual            VIRGILD(8)

NAME
       virgild - connection service for remote clients

SYNOPSIS
       ndb/cs
       ip/virgild

DESCRIPTION
       Virgild  receives  requests  for  name service on UDP/IP port
       virgil, defined as 2202 by  services(6),  and  hard-coded  in
       virgil(2).  Each request has the form:

              userid?machine-name

       Virgild  translates  the machine-name using the local connec‐
       tion server (see cs(8)), and sends a response of the  follow‐
       ing form to the requesting client:

              userid?machine-name=network-address

       If  the  machine-name  cannot be translated, virgild makes no
       response; unless another server replies, the client's request
       will time out.

       Virgild requires that cs(8) be running before it is started.

BUGS
       The  userid  part  is  currently  unused  but  must  still be
       included.
       Virgild is single threaded: a delay in translating a name for
       one client will delay response to any subsequent clients.
