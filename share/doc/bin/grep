GREP(1)                General Commands Manual               GREP(1)

NAME
       grep - pattern matching

SYNOPSIS
       grep [ -lnviLs ] pattern [ file...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Grep  prints  lines  from each file that match the pattern, a
       regular expression as defined in regex(2).  If no  files  are
       given,  standard  input  is  used.   If more than one file is
       given, each line of output is preceded by  the  name  of  the
       file it was found in.  The options are:

       -l        Print  only  the  name of each file that contains a
                 match.

       -L        Print the name of each file that does not contain a
                 match.

       -n        Precede each line of output with its line number.

       -v        Print only lines that do not match pattern.

       -i        Pattern matching is case insensitive (roman letters
                 only).

       -s        Do not print anything; yield only the exit status.

       made, or if an error has occurred.
