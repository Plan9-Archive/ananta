NAME
       dd - convert and copy a file

SYNOPSIS
       dd [ option value ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Dd  copies  the  specified input file to the specified output
       with possible conversions.  The standard input and output are
       used  by  default.   The  input  and output block size may be
       specified to take advantage of raw physical I/O.  The options
       are

       -if f  Open file f for input.

       -of f  Open file f for output.

       -ibs n Set input block size to n bytes (default 512).

       -obs n Set output block size (default 512).

       -bs n  Set  both input and output block size, superseding ibs
              and obs.  If no conversion is specified, preserve  the
              input  block size instead of packing short blocks into
              the output buffer.   This  is  particularly  efficient
              since no in-core copy need be done.

       -cbs n Set conversion buffer size.

       -skip n
              Skip n input records before copying.

       -iseek n
              Seek n records forward on input file before copying.

       -files n
              Catenate  n input files (useful only for magnetic tape
              or similar input device).

       -oseek n
              Seek n records from beginning of  output  file  before
              copying.

       -count n
              Copy only n input records.

       -conv ascii    Convert EBCDIC to ASCII.

             ebcdic   Convert ASCII to EBCDIC.

             ibm      Like  ebcdic  but  with  a  slightly different
                      character map.

             block    Convert variable length ASCII records to fixed
                      length.

             unblock  Convert fixed length ASCII records to variable
                      length.

             lcase    Map alphabetics to lower case.

             ucase    Map alphabetics to upper case.

             swab     Swap every pair of bytes.

             noerror  Do not stop processing on an error.

             sync     Pad every input record to ibs bytes.

       Where sizes are specified, a number of bytes is expected.   A
       number  may  end with or to specify multiplication by 1024 or
       512 respectively; a pair of numbers may be  separated  by  to
       indicate a product.  Multiple conversions may be specified in
       the style:

       is used only if or conversion is specified.  In the first two
       cases,  n  characters  are copied into the conversion buffer,
       any specified character mapping is done, trailing blanks  are
       trimmed  and new-line is added before sending the line to the
       output.  In the latter three cases, characters are read  into
       the conversion buffer and blanks are added to make up an out‚Äê
       put record of size n.  If is unspecified  or  zero,  the  and
       options  convert the character set without changing the block
       structure of the input file; the and options become a  simple
       file copy.
