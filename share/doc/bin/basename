NAME
       basename - strip file name affixes

SYNOPSIS
       basename [ -d ] string [ suffix ]

DESCRIPTION
       Basename  deletes any prefix ending in slash (/) and the suf‚Äê
       fix, if present in string, from string, and prints the result
       on the standard output.

       The  -d  option  instead prints the directory component, that
       is, string up to but not including the final slash.   If  the
       string  contains  no  slash,  the  current  directory name is
       printed.
