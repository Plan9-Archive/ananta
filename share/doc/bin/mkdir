MKDIR(1)               General Commands Manual              MKDIR(1)

NAME
       mkdir - make a directory

SYNOPSIS
       mkdir [ -p ] [ dirname ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mkdir  creates  the  specified directories. It requires write
       permission in the parent directory.

       The -p option causes mkdir to create the whole path  dirname,
       including  any  missing  parent directories; it also will not
       complain if dirname already exists and is a directory.

       The new directories are  created  with  permissions  starting
       with  8r777  but  masked  with  the permissions of the parent
       directory according to the procedure followed by sys-open(2).
       For  example,  if the parent directory lacks write permission
       for group and has no permissions  for  others,  so  will  the
       newly created directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If any directory cannot be created successfully, mkdir prints
       a warning, and continues with any remaining directories,  but
       returns "error" exit status at the end.
