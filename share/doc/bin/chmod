NAME
       chmod - change file mode (permissions)

SYNOPSIS
       chmod mode file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Chmod  changes  the mode (permissions) of each file according
       to mode, which may be an octal number or a symbolic change to
       the existing mode.

       A  mode  can be numerically formed as the OR of the following
       octal values (a leading 8r is ignored):

       0400   read by owner

       0200   write by owner

       0100   execute (search in directory) by owner

       0070   read, write, execute (search) by group

       0007   read, write, execute (search) by others

       A symbolic mode has the form:

              [who] op permission

       The who part is a combination of the letters  u  (for  user's
       permissions),  g  (group) and o (other).  The letter a stands
       for ugo.  If who is omitted, the default is a.

       The op field can be: + to add permission to the file's  mode,
       -  to take away permission, = to assign permission absolutely
       (all other bits being reset).

       The permission field is any  combination  of  the  letters  r
       (read), w (write), x (execute), a (append only), l (exclusive
       access), and t (temporary, not archived).

       ating systems, particularly variants of Windows.
