FTEST(1)               General Commands Manual              FTEST(1)

NAME
       ftest, newer - test file attributes

SYNOPSIS
       ftest test arg

       newer file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       Ftest checks the specified attribute of arg according to test
       and yields an exit status signifying  the  result.   For  all
       tests  apart  from  -t,  arg  is  the  name of the file to be
       tested; for -t, it  is  the  number  of  a  file  descriptor.
       Available tests are:

       -d     True if the file exists and is a directory.

       -e     True if the file exists.

       -f     True if the file exists and is a regular file.

       -r     True if the file exists and is readable.

       -s     True if the file exists and has non-zero size.

       -t     True  if  the  open file represented by the number arg
              represents the same file as /dev/cons.

       -w     True if the file exists and is writable.

       -x     True if the file exists and is executable.

       Newer checks whether file1 exists and is no older than file2,
       which  must  also exist; if so, it yields a true exit status.
       Otherwise, it yields an error status.  Neither file may be  a
       directory.

BUGS
       These  commands  work  only  with  sh(1) as none of the other
       Inferno shells can check the exit status of a command.

       Checking for read, write and execute capabilities is specula‚Äê
       tive  -  the file server has the last say.  Group permissions
       are ignored.
