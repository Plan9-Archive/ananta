NAME
       ebook - Open Ebook browser

SYNOPSIS
       ebook/ebook [ -m ] file

DESCRIPTION
       Ebook provides a graphical browser for a set of files in Open
       eBook (OEB) version 1.0.1 format. It takes some care  to  try
       to  ensure  that memory usage does not grow proportionally to
       the size of the book that is being viewed.  File names either
       an OEB package file (conventional suffix .opf) or an OEB doc‚Äê
       ument (conventional suffix .html or  .xml).   The  -m  option
       causes  the window to be created in ``mini'' size as suitable
       for display on a 240x320 pixel device.

   GUI controls
       Controls at the top of the window enable  the  user  to  move
       forward  and  backwards  by  pages  through  the document.  A
       ``Guide'' menu provides access to the guide as found  in  the
       ebook  package  (if  there  is one). If the links in this are
       followed, or if the reader follows links embedded within  the
       document,  the up and down arrows enable moving backwards and
       forwards in the ``link history''.   Arrows  on  the  keyboard
       mimic the actions of the buttons at the top of the window.

       Clicking  in  the  text  allows  an annotation to made on the
       text; a text window is popped up and any  text  typed  in  it
       will  appear  in  a label attached to that text.  Annotations
       are stored in persistent storage and will last from  view  to
       view of the document.
