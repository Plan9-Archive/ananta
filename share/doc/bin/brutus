BRUTUS(1)              General Commands Manual             BRUTUS(1)

NAME
       brutus - screen editor with support for SGML

SYNOPSIS
       wm/brutus [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Brutus is a multi-file editor for UTF format text files.

       When  editing  multiple  files,  each file appears in its own
       window.  Button 1 can be  used  to  make  a  window  current.
       Within  the  current  window,  button 1 selects text.  Double
       clicking selects text up to the boundaries of  words,  lines,
       quoted  text or bracketed text depending upon the text at the
       point of the double click. Double clicking at the start of  a
       line  selects  the  entire  line. Double clicking just inside
       various forms of brace selects text up to the matching brace,
       correctly  handling  nested braces.  Button 2 displays a menu
       of editing commands:

       cut    Delete the selected text and save it in the snarf buf‐
              fer.

       paste  Replace the selected text by the contents of the snarf
              buffer.

       snarf  Save the selected text in the snarf buffer.

       look   Search forwards and select the next occurrence of  the
              selected text.

       Mouse  chording  is  implemented,  as in acme(1).  Dragging a
       selection with button-1 held down and then also clicking but‐
       ton-2 cuts the selected text into the Snarf buffer.  Clicking
       button-3 instead of button-2 replaces the selected text  with
       the contents of the Snarf buffer.

       Clicking  button  3  extracts  the  whitespace-bounded string
       around the point of the click and plumbs it to the  appropri‐
       ate application (see plumber(8)).

       A  brutus  console  window is always displayed from which new
       files may be opened or from which existing open files may  be
       selected.  Typing

              /word

       in  the console window will search for the character sequence
       word in the file associated with the current window. Typing

              ?word

       in the console window will search backwards for the character
       sequence word.  If text has been selected in the current win‐
       dow the search begins  from  the  end  of  the  selection  if
       searching  forwards  and  the  beginning  of the selection if
       searching backwards.  If no text has been selected the search
       begins from the current insertion point.  Typing

              linenumber

       in the console window selects all the text on line linenumber
       and moves the window to show the selected text.

   SGML
       If the first line of a file is exactly:

              <SGML>

       it is assumed to be in SGML format and the contents are  dis‐
       played according to some predefined formatting rules. Tags of
       the form <font.size> are recognised and used to  control  the
       visual  appearance  of  text.  The font may be one of: Roman,
       Italic, Bold, and Type giving normal, italicised, emboldened,
       and  constant  width  text.  The size may be one of 6, 8, 10,
       12, or 16, and determines the point  size  of  the  displayed
       text.

PLUMBING
       wm/brutus  listens for edit messages and plumbs text selected
       by button 3
