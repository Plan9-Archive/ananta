TOOLBAR(1)             General Commands Manual            TOOLBAR(1)

NAME
       toolbar - window manager toolbar

SYNOPSIS
       wm/toolbar [ -s ] [ -p ]

DESCRIPTION
       Toolbar  is designed to be run as the controlling application
       under an instance of wm(1).  It runs an initialisation  shell
       script,  provides  a menu allowing the user to start new pro‐
       grams.  and shows icons representing windows that  have  been
       hidden.

       When toolbar is started, it configures itself by means of the
       /lib/wmsetup shell script.  Toolbar loads  the  shell  sh(1),
       and defines the following shell built-in commands before exe‐
       cuting the script:

       menu title1 [title2] command
              Insert an item at the top of the start  menu.   Title1
              is  the  text of the item on the main menu.  If title2
              is given then title1 is a sub-menu with title2 as  the
              menu  item.  Command is executed by the shell whenever
              the item is selected.  An item with an  empty  command
              is displayed as a separator.

       delmenu
              Forget all menu items.

       The   standard   /lib/wmsetup   script  executes  the  script
       /usr/username/lib/wmsetup, enabling each user to  have  their
       own window manager configuration.

       Normally  toolbar  packs a menu button referring to the start
       menu at the left hand side of the tool bar.   The  -s  option
       suppresses that.

       Toolbar  serves the shared snarf buffer used by cut and paste
       in wm(1) applications, except in  hosted  Inferno  where  the
       host's   standard  clipboard  system  is  used  instead,  via
       snarf(3).  If toolbar  cannot  find  /chan/snarf  or  the  -p
       option  is  given,  toolbar will create its own snarf buffer,
       private to the set of applications running under the  current
       instance of wm(1).
