FILENAME(1)            General Commands Manual           FILENAME(1)

NAME
       filename - interactively select a file

SYNOPSIS
       wm/filename  [  -d startdir ] [ -g geom ] [ -t title ] [ pat‐
       tern...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Filename pops up a file browser window, allows  the  user  to
       select  a  file and prints the name of that file to the stan‐
       dard output.  The optional list of patterns gives a  list  of
       wildcard  patterns  as  understood  by  filepat(2);  the file
       browser will initially show only files matching one  or  more
       of the patterns. (N.B. patterns must be quoted to prevent the
       shell from interpreting  them).  The  following  options  are
       recognised:

       -d        Startdir  gives  the initial directory shown by the
                 file browser.

       -g        Geom is given as a tk argument to the file  browser
                 window.

       -t        Title  specifies the title of the file browser win‐
                 dow.

EXAMPLE
       The following sh(1) command compiles an interactively  chosen
       Limbo  source file, placing the file browser window at a par‐
       ticular spot on the screen and starting at joe's home  direc‐
       tory.
       limbo `{wm/filename -t 'Select a source file' -g '-x 50 -y 50'
            -d/usr/joe '*.b' '*.m'}

SOURCE
       /appl/wm/filename.b

BUGS

       to the right of the position specified.
