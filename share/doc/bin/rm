RM(1)                  General Commands Manual                 RM(1)

NAME
       rm - remove file(s)

SYNOPSIS
       rm [ -fr ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Rm  removes  the specified files or directories.  A directory
       is removed only if it is  empty  (but  see  the  -r  option).
       Removal of a file requires write permission in its directory,
       but requires neither read nor write permission  on  the  file
       itself.  The options are:

       -f     Suppress diagnostics

       -r     Recursively  remove  a directory's substructure before
              removing the directory.
