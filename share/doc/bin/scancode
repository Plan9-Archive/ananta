NAME
       scancode - known formats of scan codes

DESCRIPTION
       The  scancode  interface  of  cons(3) provides access to scan
       codes of the primary keyboard. There are as  many  scan  code
       formats as keyboards. Here are some common ones.

Microsoft Windows™ Virtual Key
       The  identifier is emu_win32vk, and each scan code is encoded
       in the two byte format specified in cons(3).  This format  is
       used by the Microsoft Windows™ implementation of emu(1E), and
       each scan code is a Virtual Key.  See the appropriate  Micro‐
       soft documentation for the meaning of the codes.

X11
       The  identifier  is emu_x11, and each scan code is encoded in
       the single byte format specified in cons(3).  This format  is
       used  by the various Unix/X11 implementations of emu(1E), and
       each scan code is an X11 keycode.  See  the  appropriate  X11
       documentation for the meaning of the codes.
