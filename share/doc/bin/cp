CP(1)                  General Commands Manual                 CP(1)

NAME
       cp, fcp - copy files

SYNOPSIS
       cp [ -gux ] fromfile tofile
       cp [ -gux ] fromfile ...  todir
       cp -r [ -gux ] fromdir ...  todir

       fcp [ -R nr ] [ -W nw ] fromfile tofile
       fcp [ -R nr ] [ -W nw ] fromfile ...  todir
       fcp -r [ -R nr ] [ -W nw ] fromdir ...  todir

DESCRIPTION
       In  the  first  form,  fromfile is any name and tofile is any
       name except an existing directory.  In the second  form,  the
       commands  copy  one  or  more  fromfiles into dir under their
       original file names, as if by a sequence of commands  in  the
       first form. For example:

              cp f1 f2 dir

       is equivalent to:

              cp f1 dir/f1;  cp f2 dir/f2

       Cp copies the contents of plain (non-directory) file fromfile
       to tofile.  The mode and owner of tofile are preserved if  it
       already  exists;  the  permissions of fromfile is used other‐
       wise.  The -x option sets the full mode and modified time  of
       file2 from file1; -g sets the group id; and -u sets the group
       id and user id (which is usually only possible  if  the  file
       server is in an administrative mode).

       The -r option directs cp to copy recursively the named direc‐
       tories fromdir ...  to the target directory todir.

       Fcp behaves like cp, but copies many blocks in parallel.   It
       works  only  with  files  that respect read and write offsets
       (see pread and pwrite in sys-read(2)), which usually excludes
       files  representing  devices  or  services.  When it applies,
       however, it is often much faster than  cp.   The  -R  and  -W
       options  set  the  number of readers and writers (default for
       each: 8).

DIAGNOSTICS
       Cp and fcp refuse to copy a file onto itself.
