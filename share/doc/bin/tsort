NAME
       tsort - topological sort

SYNOPSIS
       tsort

DESCRIPTION
       Tsort  reads  a set of partial order relations between labels
       (sequences of non-space characters) from its standard  input,
       and lists the labels on its standard output one per line fol‐
       lowing a topological sort.  Each input line represents a  set
       of inequalities: the first label on the line is less than all
       the others on the same line, and  should  appear  earlier  in
       sorted  order.   (The  relation  might for instance represent
       arcs in a directed graph, from the first label on a  line  to
       the  others,  or dependency relationships.)  Labels on a line
       are separated by space or tab.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If the input contains cycles, tsort prints  a  diagnostic  on
       standard error for each cycle, listing its members.  The mem‐
       bers of each cycle will also appear on the  standard  output,
       in any order, but after any predecessors outside the cycle.
