FTREE(1)               General Commands Manual              FTREE(1)

NAME
       ftree - file tree browser

SYNOPSIS
       wm/ftree [ [-e ] [ -E ] [ -p ] [ -d ] [ root ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ftree  displays  the  given  root directory (default: /) in a
       graphical form as  a  tree.   Files  and  subdirectories  are
       listed  beneath the directory that contains them.  Initially,
       the contents of a subdirectory are not displayed, but select‐
       ing  the  ⊕  symbol next to its name with button 1 causes its
       contents to be displayed there, and the ⊕ symbol  changes  to
       ⊖;  clicking  that collapses the subdirectory display back to
       its name.  (If the directory is empty,  the  circle  will  be
       empty.)   Selecting  a  file  or directory name with button 1
       pops up a menu of operations: Open,  Copy,  Paste  into,  and
       Remove.  Open plumbs the full path name of the file or direc‐
       tory; it is up to the plumber(8) to act  appropriately  based
       on  the  structure  of  the  file  name, as controlled by the
       user's plumbing(6) file.  Typically images will be  displayed
       in  a separate window, source files will be opened in an edi‐
       tor, and so on.  Directory structure can be copied by  invok‐
       ing  Copy  on  the source, then Paste into on the destination
       directory.  The -d option  disallows  all  operations  except
       Open.

       Normally, ftree displays the usual wm(1) controls, and inter‐
       prets them as usual.  The other options  change  that  behav‐
       iour:

       -e     Ignore `exit' but offer move or resize.

       -E     Ignore exit, and do not offer move or resize.

       -p     Do exit, but do not offer move or resize.

       The  different  options  are used to program a user interface
       for handheld touch screen devices.   For  instance,  a  start
       panel  can  be  created by invoking ftree with the -E option,
       ensuring that the ftree screen is always there, and all  sub‐
       sequent  interaction can be controlled by the construction of
       the root namespace and suitable choice of plumbing rules.
