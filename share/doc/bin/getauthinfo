GETAUTHINFO(8)         System Manager's Manual        GETAUTHINFO(8)

NAME
       getauthinfo - obtain a certificate for authentication

SYNOPSIS
       getauthinfo keyname

       wm/getauthinfo

DESCRIPTION
       Getauthinfo  makes  contact  with logind(8) on a `signer', or
       certifying authority, with which the user has previously been
       registered using changelogin(8), to obtain a certificate that
       can later be presented to other Inferno services to authenti‐
       cate the user.  If keyname starts with a `/', the certificate
       is  stored  there;  otherwise,  it  is  stored  in  the  file
       /usr/user/keyring/keyname,   where   user   is  the  name  in
       /dev/user (see  cons(3)).   The  directory  /usr/user/keyring
       must exist.

       The user is prompted for the following:

       signer The   name   of   the   signing  server,  for  example
              signer.froop.com.  The default is the  default  signer
              for the site: the value of SIGNER in the local network
              configuration database (see ndb(6)).

       remote user name
              The name of the user for whom a certificate is  to  be
              obtained.  The  default  is  the  current user name in
              /dev/user.

       password
              The user's  password.  The  password  entered  on  the
              client  must  match  the password previously stored on
              the server using changelogin(8), or a certificate will
              be refused.

       save in file?
              The  default  is `no'. If the user responds `yes', the
              certificate is written directly to the  file.   Other‐
              wise,  getauthinfo  becomes  a  file server, serving a
              secure temporary file bound over the file  name  above
              (because that is where applications look for it).  The
              temporary will disappear if the name is unmounted,  or
              Inferno is rebooted.

       Note  that the certificate will expire at or before expiry of
       the password entry on the signer.

       The signer needs its own key to endorse the certificates that
       it  gives  to clients.  If a user requests a certificate with
       getauthinfo(8) before the signer's  key  is  created  on  the
       signer  (eg, using createsignerkey(8)), then the request will
       be rejected with a suitable diagnostic by logind(8).

   File servers
       Machines that will be file servers must obtain a  certificate
       and save the certificate in a key file named default, thus:

              getauthinfo default

       The user invoking getauthinfo must be the same user who later
       runs svc(8) to start the machine's services.

   File server clients
       Machines that  wish  to  be  authenticated  clients  of  file
       servers  must  obtain a certificate and store the certificate
       in a file  named  net!machine.   The  file  name  must  match
       exactly  the server address given to mount (see bind(1)).  To
       set the key, use

              getauthinfo net!host

   Window system interface
       Getauthinfo has a visual counterpart wm/getauthinfo  for  use
       under  wm(1).   It  takes no arguments.  It displays a window
       prompting for all the  information  it  needs,  and  offering
       apparently  sensible  defaults.   Apart  from  the  different
       interface, its function is otherwise the same as the  command
       line version.

FILES
       /usr/user/keyring/net!machine
              where a certificate is stored on a client machine

       /usr/user/keyring/default
              where a certificate is stored on a file server

       /lib/ndb/local
              contains the default host name of the signer
