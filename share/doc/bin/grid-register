GRID-REGISTER(1)       General Commands Manual      GRID-REGISTER(1)

NAME
       grid:  register  -  registers  a  resource  with a known reg‐
       istry(4)

SYNOPSIS
       grid/register [ option ...  ] { command ...  }

DESCRIPTION
       Register takes a program that serves a namespace using the 9P
       protocol  on its standard input and registers it with a known
       registery(4).  (See intro(5) for a description of the  proto‐
       col.)  It then marshals the service by listening for incoming
       connections and exporting the namespace across them.   Regis‐
       ter  prints out various status messages to stdout in the form
       which may be read by grid-monitor(1).

OPTIONS
       -u maxusers      Specifies the maximum number of  connections
                        to  the  resource  at  any  one time. If not
                        given,  any  number   of   connections   are
                        allowed.

       -e n             Tells  register  to exit after the last con‐
                        nection has gone away.   N  is  a  threshold
                        value,  so  that register will not exit upon
                        the last connection  going  away  until  the
                        number  of  incoming connections has reached
                        at least n.

       -a 'name=value'  Specifies the name and value of an attribute
                        to  be  listed  as belonging to the resource
                        when registered with the registry(4).

       -A address       Allows the user to specify the  address  for
                        the  service  to announce on.  Address takes
                        the form tcp!machine!port

       -m               Includes the amount of free main  memory  as
                        part of the attributes list.
