NAME
       tee - pipe fitting

SYNOPSIS
       tee [ -a ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tee  reads the standard input and writes a copy of each block
       read to each file in turn, and then to the  standard  output.
       Normally tee rewrites each file; the -a option causes data to
       be appended instead.
