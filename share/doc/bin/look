LOOK(1)                General Commands Manual               LOOK(1)

NAME
       look - find lines in a sorted list

SYNOPSIS
       look [ -dfnix ] [ -r endkey ] [ -tc ] [ string ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Look  consults  a sorted file and prints all lines that begin
       with string.  It uses binary search.

       The following options are recognised:

       -i     Interactive.  There is  no  string  argument;  instead
              look takes lines from the standard input as strings to
              be looked up.

       -x     Exact.  Print only lines of the file whose key matches
              string exactly.

       -d     `Directory'  order:  only  letters,  digits,  tabs and
              blanks participate in comparisons.

       -f     Fold.  Upper case letters compare equal to lower case.

       -n     Numeric comparison  with  initial  string  of  digits,
              optional minus sign, and optional decimal point.

       -r endkey
              Limit  the  range  of  matching values, to include the
              word endkey but no larger values.

       -t[c]  Character c terminates the sort key in the  file.   By
              default,  tab terminates the key.  If c is missing the
              entire line comprises the key.

       If no file is specified, /lib/words is assumed, with  collat‚Äê
       ing sequence df.

DIAGNOSTICS

       dictionary" if file  or  the  default  dictionary  cannot  be
       opened.
