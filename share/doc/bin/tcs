NAME
       tcs - translate character sets

SYNOPSIS
       tcs -l [-v] [ csname ]

       tcs [ -f ics ] [ -t ocs ] [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tcs  converts  its  input from the ics character set encoding
       into Unicode runes and then outputs the data in the  encoding
       of  the ocs character set.  The default values of ics and ocs
       are both utf8.  This is the  standard  Inferno  Unicode  text
       encoding  as  described by utf(6).  If no files are specified
       tcs reads from its standard input.

       The -l option causes tcs to output the list of character sets
       that  it  understands.   The -v option causes a more detailed
       listing to be given.  Giving a  csname  argument  to  the  -l
       option  causes  tcs  to list the known aliases for that name.
       The first name in the list is  the  standard  (or  preferred)
       name.

FILES
       /lib/convcs/charsets
              Specifies  the  supported  character  set names, their
              aliases and the implementation of their converters.
