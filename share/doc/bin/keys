KEYS(6)                     Games Manual                     KEYS(6)

NAME
       keys - secrets shared with signer

DESCRIPTION
       The  file  /keydb/keys  exists  only  on  a  host acting as a
       `signer' (authentication server, Certifying  Authority).   It
       holds  a  password  entry  for  each  user registered with an
       Inferno server.  Each entry contains a user name, a password,
       the  time at which the entry expires, and the entry's status.
       The password is the secret shared between the user and signer
       (authentication  server),  allowing the signer to sign a cer‐
       tificate to authenticate a user's public key to others, using
       the  secret  to check the user's identity.  The actual secret
       is not stored, but rather its SHA-1 hash.

       The file is encrypted with a secret provided by the  signer's
       administrator;  normally  that  secret  is  entered once when
       authentication services are started by svc/auth on  the  host
       acting as signer (see svc(8)).  The file should also be read‐
       able and writable only by the user  identity  that  runs  the
       signing  service  (ie,  mode 600, see chmod(1)).  Entries are
       usually accessed only through  the  name  space  provided  by
       keyfs(4),  which  decrypts the file into internal data struc‐
       tures given the administrative key, and makes each entry vis‐
       ible as a separate directory.  Using that name space, entries
       are added and updated by  an  administrator  using  changelo‐
       gin(8),  a  user  can  change  a  secret  using passwd(1) via
       keysrv(4), and it is accessed for  signing  by  logind(8)  to
       obtain  the  secret  used  to verify the identity of a client
       requesting a certificate (typically via security-login(2)).
