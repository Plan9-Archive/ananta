CMP(1)                 General Commands Manual                CMP(1)

NAME
       cmp - compare two files

SYNOPSIS
       cmp [ -lsL ] file1 file2 [ offset1 [ offset2 ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       The two files are compared.  A diagnostic results if the con‚Äê
       tents differ, otherwise there is no output.  By default,  cmp
       prints the byte number of the first differing byte.

       The options are:

       -l     Print  the  byte  number  (decimal)  and the differing
              bytes (hexadecimal) for each difference.

       -s     Print nothing for differing files, but  set  the  exit
              status.

       -L     Print the line number of the first differing byte.

       If  offsets  are  given,  comparison starts at the designated
       byte position of the corresponding file.  Offsets that  begin
       with  0x  are hexadecimal; with 0, octal; with anything else,
       decimal.
