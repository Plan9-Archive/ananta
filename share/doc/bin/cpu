CPU(1)                 General Commands Manual                CPU(1)

NAME
       cpu - execute a remote command

SYNOPSIS
       cpu [ -C alg ] [net!]host [ command [ arg...  ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Cpu  dials  host  (using  network  tcp  if net is not given),
       exports the local namespace and executes the given command on
       that  machine.  The local namespace is visible to the command
       in /n/client; local device files are bound  into  the  remote
       device  directory.   If command is not given, then /dis/sh is
       run.

       The -C option sets the algorithm to be used following authen‐
       tication for digesting or encryption, to alg.  See ssl(3) for
       the supported algorithms.  The default is none: ssl(3) is not
       used after authentication.

BUGS
       Although the draw device files are visible to the remote com‐
       mand, the original implementation of Tk meant that  windowing
       applications  could  not  receive  events  when run remotely.
       That has been fixed in this release, but cpu has not yet been
       updated to take advantage.  A later update will do that.
