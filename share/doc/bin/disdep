DISDEP(1)              General Commands Manual             DISDEP(1)

NAME
       disdep - print load dependencies for Dis file

SYNOPSIS
       disdep [ -a ] [ -d ] [ -o ] [ -p ] [ -s ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Disdep  reads each file, which must be a Dis object file, and
       finds all unique strings in it that end in  .dis.   It  takes
       each  such  string as the name of a Dis file, and if the file
       exists, it does the same for it, and so on, recursively.   It
       writes  each  unique name to the standard output.  The result
       is a list of all statically-named Dis  files  that  might  be
       referenced  by  an application, typically as the operand of a
       Limbo load operator.  Several options change  or  extend  the
       output:

       -a     Print all names as they are encountered in the search,
              including duplicates.

       -d     Indent to show the dependency structure.

       -o     Show only the immediate  (outermost)  dependencies  of
              each file.

       -p     Print  the  dependency  relation  as  pairs: a file, a
              space, and the name of a file  on  which  it  depends.
              Only the the first name is printed when a file depends
              on no other.   This  format  is  useful  as  input  to
              mk(10.1) dependency generators, or dependency graphing
              programs.

       -s     Include strings of the form "$[A-Z].*"  on the assump‚Äê
              tion  they  are  the names of system modules loaded by
              the application.
