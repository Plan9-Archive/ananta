8(PING)                                                      8(PING)

NAME
       ping - probe the Internet

SYNOPSIS
       ip/ping  [-alq] [ -i interval ] [ -s size ] [ -n nping ] des‐
       tination

DESCRIPTION
       Ping sends ICMP echo requests to a network destination (which
       has the syntax accepted by dial(2)).  The target host, if up,
       should send a corresponding reply.  By default, one  line  is
       printed  for  each  reply,  containing  the  sequence  number
       (starting at 0) of the message it  answers,  the  round  trip
       time  for that reply, the average round trip time so far, and
       the `time to live' value from the reply packet.

       The options are:

       -a     include source and destination  IP  addresses  in  the
              output

       -i interval
              send  requests  with  the  given interval between mes‐
              sages, in milliseconds (default: 1 second)

       -l     list only lost messages

       -n nping
              send nping messages in all (default: 32)

       -q     suppress per-packet output, giving summary data only

       -s size
              send request  packets  of  the  given  size  in  bytes
              (default: 64, minimum 32)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Ping yields an error status if any request had no correspond‐
       ing reply.

BUGS
       Works only on native Inferno and when hosted on Plan 9, owing
       to the lack of access to ICMP on other hosted systems.
