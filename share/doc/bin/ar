AR(1)                  General Commands Manual                 AR(1)

NAME
       ar - archive maintainer

SYNOPSIS
       ar key [ posname ] afile [ file ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ar  maintains  groups of files combined into a single archive
       file, afile.  The main use of ar is to produce and manipulate
       UNIX  archive  files, for instance to create program packages
       for Debian Linux.  Note that only iar(10.1)  can  manage  ar‐
       chives  used as object file libraries by the Inferno and Plan
       9 loaders.

       Key is one character from the set  drqtpmx,  optionally  con‐
       catenated  with  one or more of vuaibclo.  The files are con‐
       stituents of the archive afile.   The  meanings  of  the  key
       characters are:

       d      Delete files from the archive file.

       r      Replace  files  in  the  archive  file, or add them if
              missing.  Optional modifiers are

              u      Replace only files with  modified  dates  later
                     than that of the archive.

              a      Place  new  files  after posname in the archive
                     rather than at the end.

              b or i Place new files before posname in the archive.

       q      Quick.  Append files to the end of the archive without
              checking for duplicates.  Avoids quadratic behavior in

       t      List a table of contents of the archive.  If names are
              given, only those files are listed.

       p      Print the named files in the archive.

       m      Move the named files to the end or  elsewhere,  speci‐
              fied as with

       o      Preserve  the  access  and modification times of files
              extracted with the x command.

       x      Extract the named files.  If no names are  given,  all
              files  in  the archive are extracted.  In neither case
              does x alter the archive file.

       v      Verbose.  Give a file-by-file description of the  mak‐
              ing of a new archive file from the old archive and the
              constituent files.  With p, precede each file  with  a
              name.   With t, give a long listing of all information
              about the files, somewhat like  a  listing  by  ls(1),
              showing
                   mode uid/gid size date name

       c      Create.   Normally  ar  will create a new archive when
              afile does not exist, and give a  warning.   Option  c
              discards any old contents and suppresses the warning.

EXAMPLE
       ar cr arch.a manifest *.tar.gz
              Replace the contents of with the manifest file and all
              the gzip(1)'d tar files in the current directory.

FILES
       /tmp/art.*.*
              temporaries

BUGS
       If the same file is mentioned twice in an argument  list,  it
       may be put in the archive twice.
       The  file format used by this command is taken from UNIX, and
       makes some invalid assumptions, for instance  that  user  IDs
       are numeric.
