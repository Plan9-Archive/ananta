ATTRDB(6)                   Games Manual                   ATTRDB(6)

NAME
       attrdb - data base of attribute-value pairs

DESCRIPTION
       An attribute data base is formed from one or more text files,
       each containing groups of related attribute-value  pairs.   A
       given  data  base  typically stores data relating to a single
       logical domain.  For instance, Inferno uses an attribute data
       base  ndb(6)  to organise network configuration data.  Attrdb
       (2) is typically used by applications to search the data.

       Each entry in the data base consists of  one  or  more  lines
       containing  attribute/value  pairs, separated by white space.
       The first line of an entry starts a line; subsequent lines in
       the  entry  are  preceded  by  white  space (spaces or tabs).
       Pairs on the same line bind tighter together than  others  in
       the  same  entry.   (This is important when one known pair is
       used to find another by attribute name.)  The  character  `#'
       causes  the  rest  of  the line to be ignored (eg, as commen‚Äê
       tary).  Empty lines are also ignored.

       Attribute/value pairs are written as  attribute=value,  which
       can  be  abbreviated to attribute= or simply attribute if the
       attribute has no value.  A value that contains  white  space,
       or  any  of  the characters #'"= must be quoted, using either
       the single  or  double  quote  character.   Within  a  quoted
       string,  two  adjacent quotes can be written to enter a quote
       in the string.  For example:

              name='Paul Wilson' business company='Fruitbat Villas Ltd'
                 title='Key Grip'
                 address='39 Willis Street, York' tel='+44 1904 20927'
                 address='On the road' tel='+44 7904 169 704'
              name='James Mason' personal=
                 address='10 St James''s, East Grinstead' tel='01342 7674'

       Note that the binding rule associates  each  address  in  the
       first  entry most closely with the tel on the same line.  The
       attributes business (first entry) and personal (second entry)
       are both attributes without value.

       A  single  logical  data  base can be formed by concatenating
       several physical files, each having the format above.  One of
       the files must contain an entry (typically first in the file)
       containing a database attribute and a sequence of  attributes
       of the form file=filename.  For example:

              database=
                 file=file1
                 file=file2
                 file=file3

       The  logical  database is formed by (logically) concatenating
       the contents of each filename in the order listed (ie, file1,
       file2,  and  file3 above).  Typically the file containing the
       database attribute appears in the list as well, at the  point
       where  its  contents should go; if it does not appear at all,
       it is assumed to be first.  The name of  that  file  is  also
       used  as  the name of the logical database, for instance when
       opened by attrdb(2).
