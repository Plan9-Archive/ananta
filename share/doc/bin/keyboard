NAME
       keyboard, pen - character input for touch screen devices

SYNOPSIS
       wm/keyboard [ -e ] [ -t ]

       wm/pen [ -e ] [ -r ] [ -t ]

DESCRIPTION
       Wm/keyboard   provides   a  soft  keyboard  for  touch-screen
       devices.  Characters selected on the on-screen keyboard using
       a  stylus  (or  mouse button 1) are passed to Tk via Tk->key‐
       board in tk(2).  The -t option causes it to put itself on the
       wm(1)  task  bar  from the start.  The -e option causes it to
       treat the `exit' button on the title bar as a request to  put
       itself back on the task bar.

       Wm/pen  provides character input using single-stroke gestures
       with the stylus (or mouse button 1).  The  -r  option  allows
       the  pen  window  to  be reshaped.  Options are otherwise the
       same as for wm/keyboard.
