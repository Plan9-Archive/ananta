NAME
       auplay, auhdr, raw2iaf, wav2iaf - basic audio output and con‐
       version

SYNOPSIS
       auplay file ...

       auhdr file ...

       raw2iaf [ option ...  ] [ -o output ] input

       wav2iaf [ input ]

       wav2iaf

DESCRIPTION
       Auplay plays each file in turn on the audio device /dev/audio
       (see  audio(3)),  setting  the  device's  characteristics  in
       /dev/audioctl to match those of the  file.   It  uses  stream
       (see  sys-read(2))  to  stream the data to the device at high
       priority.  All files played must be in  `Inferno  audio  for‐
       mat', as defined by audio(6).

       Auhdr  writes  the header of each Inferno audio input file to
       the standard output.  The header describes the data in a form
       that  can  be  written  directly  to /dev/audioctl to set the
       device's characteristics.

       Raw2iaf converts the input file, adds an  appropriate  header
       to  describe  the  data in the Inferno format, and writes the
       result to the output file.  The options tell how the bytes in
       the input file should be interpreted:

       -8     rate is 8000 Hz

       -1     rate is 11025 Hz

       -2     rate is 22050 Hz

       -4     rate is 44100 Hz

       -m     mono (one channel)

       -s     stereo (two channels)

       -b     each sample in each channel is one byte (unsigned)

       -w     each sample in each channel is 16-bits (little-endian)

       -a     input is a-law encoded

       -u     input is μ-law encoded

       -p     input is PCM encoded

       Wav2iaf  reads  the  input file, which must be in Windows WAV
       format and encoded  using  PCM,  and  converts  the  data  to
       Inferno format on the standard output.
