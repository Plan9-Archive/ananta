STREAM(1)              General Commands Manual             STREAM(1)

NAME
       stream - stream data between source and sink

SYNOPSIS
       stream [-a] [-b bufsize] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Stream  creates  a process that uses stream (see sys-read(2))
       to stream data in chunks of at most bufsize  bytes  (default:
       or  8192  bytes) from file1 to the standard output.  If file2
       is provided, the two files are instead cross-connected by two
       streaming  processes:  one process streams data from file1 to
       file2, and the other streams data from file2  to  file1.   In
       all cases, stream writes data to the destination file in full
       buffers of bufsize bytes.

       Stream waits for  all  streaming  processes  to  stop  before
       returning,  unless  the  -a  (asynchronous)  option is given,
       which causes it to return after spawning the streamers.
