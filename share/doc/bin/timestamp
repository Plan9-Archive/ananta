TIMESTAMP(1)           General Commands Manual          TIMESTAMP(1)

NAME
       timestamp - log event times

SYNOPSIS
       timestamp [ tag ]

DESCRIPTION
       Timestamp reads lines from its standard input and writes them
       to its standard output, prefixing each  line  with  the  time
       that  it was written, in decimal milliseconds since timestamp
       was started. If tag is given, it is written  along  with  the
       time stamp on each line, to enable tagging if several writers
       are each writing to the same log file.

       The first line written gives  the  time  that  timestamp  was
       started,  in milliseconds since the epoch.  Note that logging
       events can cause timings to change, and that  the  timestamps
       are only as accurate as the times reported by /dev/time.
