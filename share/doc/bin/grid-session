GRID-SESSION(1)        General Commands Manual       GRID-SESSION(1)

NAME
       grid:  session  -  graphical  interface for configuring tasks
       using grid-cpu(4) and grid-ns(1) resources

SYNOPSIS
       grid/session

DESCRIPTION
       Session allows the user to build up a single  namespace  from
       various  different namespace resources and configure a set of
       commands to be executed within this namespace. The  execution
       then   takes  place  on  one  or  more  selected  grid-cpu(4)
       resources.

       Once started, session presents a heirarchical  view  of  cur‐
       rently  registered  resources (such as grid-ns(1)) that serve
       name spaces using 9P.  (See intro(5) for a description of the
       protocol.)   The top level displays the type of resource, for
       instance 'CPUresource', whilst the  second  level  shows  the
       name  of each individual resource. Descending futher down the
       tree will reveal the attributes of the selected resource.  To
       mount  a  resource  and  see  the namespace it exports, click
       mouse button 3 on the resource name. The view will switch  to
       a  split  pane  view  displaying  the resource namespace with
       directories listed on the left and all files in  the  current
       directory displayed on the right.

       Clicking  mouse button 3 on a file or directory will cause it
       to be added to the command or namespace list at the bottom of
       the  window.  Mouse button 3 is again used on items in either
       of these lists to display a menu containing the name  of  the
       resource  on  which they are located as well as the option to
       remove them. The Cmd and Ns buttons located at the top of the
       window  toggle the view between the selected commands and the
       selected namespace. The Resources button returns to the  ini‐
       tial  view  containing the currently registered resources and
       Refresh updates the list in  case  any  resources  have  been
       added or removed.

   The Command List
       This  contains  a  list  of  all commands to be executed. Any
       arguments may be entered by clicking on the gap  after  args:
       and  typing  into the box. Commands will be executed in order
       from top (first) to bottom (last).

   The Namespace List
       This contains a list of all the directories to be imported in
       order  to  create  the  local namespace of the selected grid-
       cpu(4) resource(s). By default, several directories  will  be
       imported  from the local machine. To select these, click but‐
       ton 3 on import local namespace and (un)check the directories
       as required. To toggle this option on and off, click button 1
       on import local namespace.   These  default  directories  are
       required  by many commands for normal execution so it is rec‐
       ommended that they are not disabled  unless  they  are  defi‐
       nitely  not needed. Importing a directory of the same name as
       one of the default directories will  automatically  overwrite
       the  default.  Therefore,  it  is  not necessary to disable a
       default directory if the same name is  to  be  imported  from
       elsewhere.

       A given directory can only be imported once so it is not pos‐
       sible, for example, to import /usr/inferno from two different
       machines.   Session will automatically import the directories
       containing each of  the  selected  commands  but  any  others
       required  must be explicitly imported. For example: If one of
       the commands is:

            /usr/inferno/runme.dis -f /appl/lib

       Session will import /usr/inferno/ but /appl/lib would have to
       be specified in the namespace list.

   Execution
       Once  the  command  and namespace lists have been configured,
       click Ok on the Session window. This will bring up the  grid-
       query(1)  window  containing  a  list  of the available grid-
       cpu(4) resources. To select one or more of these  for  execu‐
       tion, click on the name with button 3 and it will be added to
       the list. If a specific grid-cpu(4) resource is not required,
       click  button  3  on  CPU  resource and select the number you
       require by clicking on the number following  the  list  entry
       and dragging the mouse up or down.

       Once  the  required grid-cpu(4) resources have been selected,
       click Ok and execution will commence.
