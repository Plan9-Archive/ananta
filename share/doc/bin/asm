ASM(1)                 General Commands Manual                ASM(1)

NAME
       asm, disdump - Dis assembler, Dis disassembler

SYNOPSIS
       asm [-l] file
       disdump file...

DESCRIPTION
       Asm  reads  one  Dis assembly language file and translates it
       into instructions for the Dis virtual machine.  The output is
       written  to  a  file whose name is created by taking the last
       element of the  input  file,  stripping  any  extension,  and
       appending  .dis For example, the output file for abc would be
       abc.dis; the output file for dir/def.s, would be def.dis.

       The assembler has one option:

       -l     Generate a listing, showing the generated object code.

       Disdump prints to the standard output the Dis virtual machine
       instructions in each of its Dis file arguments.
