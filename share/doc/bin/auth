NAME
       auth - authentication using station-to-station protocol

DESCRIPTION
       The  following protocol, based on the Station-to-Station pro‐
       tocol, is used for mutual authentication of two parties, each
       possessing  a  certificate from the same certifying authority
       (CA).

       In the description below:

       alpha  is a Diffie-Hellman base used system wide

       p      is a Diffie-Hellman modulus used system wide

       Rx     is a random number of the same order as p.

       PKx    the public key of x

       SKx    the private key of x

       CERTx  the public key of x signed by the certifying authority

       sign(x)
              represents x signed with n's private key

       In the following, the parties are labelled 0 and 1.

       Each sends its  public  key  and  certificate  to  the  other
       together with a computation alpha**r0 mod p (alpha**r1 mod p)
       based on the Diffie-Hellman parameters contained in the  cer‐
       tificate:

              0 → 1  alpha**r0 mod p, CERTu0, PKu0
              1 → 0  alpha**r1 mod p, CERTu1, PKu1

       Each  can  now  use  the  CA's public key and the certificate
       received to check that each has the other's public key.

       Finally, each user signs values known to both that  each  can
       then verify:

              0 → 1  sig0(alpha**r0 mod p, alpha**r1 mod p)
              1 → 0  sig1(alpha**r0 mod p, alpha**r1 mod p)

       At  this  point  0  and  1  can  calculate  the shared secret
       alpha**(r0*r1), and can use it to  encrypt  later  communica‐
       tions.
