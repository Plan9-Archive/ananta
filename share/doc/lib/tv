NAME
       tv - Hauppage TV device

SYNOPSIS
       bind -b #V /dev

       /dev/tv
       /dev/tvctl

DESCRIPTION
       The  tv  device  serves two files giving access to a Hauppage
       television card in NTSC mode (only).

       The control device tvctl accepts the  following  commands  to
       control tuning and image processing:

       init   Reset the device to the default settings.

       window minx miny maxx maxy
              Set the display window size (default: none).

       colorkey rl rh gl gh bl bh
              Set  the key limits for chromakey display to the given
              `low' and `high' values for each  of  red,  green  and
              blue  (default: 15 63 255 15 15 63), and enable use of
              the colour key.  The value 255 for a lower limit  dis‐
              ables the limit.

       capture minx miny maxx maxy
              Set  the  capture  window  (default:  none);  see  the
              description of reading the tv file, below.

       capbrightness n
              Set the brightness of a captured  frame  to  n,  on  a
              scale from 0 to 100 (default: 13).

       capcontrast n
              Set  the contrast of a captured frame to n, on a scale
              from 0 to 100 (default: 57).

       capsaturation n
              Set the saturation of a captured  frame  to  n,  on  a
              scale from 0 to 100 (default: 51).

       caphue n
              Set  the hue of a captured frame to n, on a scale from
              0 to 100 (default: 0).

       capbw n
              Capture colour (n=0) or  monochrome  (n=1);  (default:
              0).

       brightness n
              Set  the  image  brightness to n, on a scale from 0 to
              100 (default: 0)

       contrast n
              Set the image contrast to n, on a scale from 0 to  100
              (default: 54)

       saturation n
              Set  image  saturation  to n, on a scale from 0 to 100
              (default: 54)

       source n
              Set the input source to n (default: video input 0).

       svideo n
              If n is non-zero, set the input capture format  to  S-
              Video.

       format n
              Set  the input format to n (0, NTSC-M; 1, NTSC-443; 2,
              external control).  Default: 0.

       channel c f
              Sets the right frequency for HRC CATV channel c,  with
              fine tuning by signed offset f (in MHz).

       volume m[ n ]
              Set  the volume of left and right channels to m and n,
              on a scale from 0 to 100 (default: 80).  If only m  is
              given, set both left and right volumes to m.

       bass n Set  the bass to n, on a scale from 0 to 100 (default:
              50).

       treble n
              Set the treble  to  n,  on  a  scale  from  0  to  100
              (default: 50).

       freeze n
              If  n  is  non-zero, freeze the current frame; if n is
              zero, unfreeze the video.

       The data file tv is read-only.  Reading is valid only after a
       capture  window  has been set (see capture above).  Each read
       at file offset 0 causes the contents of the input video image
       within the previously-set capture window to be captured.  The
       frame data is successively returned in  this  and  subsequent
       reads until a short read signals that all frame data has been
       transferred.  The data is returned in Plan 9 picfile  format,
       with  a  two  line  textual header followed by an empty line,
       followed by the image data in binary format.  The header  has
       the form:

              TYPE=ccir601
              WINDOW=minx miny maxx maxy

       The  WINDOW coordinates are those of the capture window.  The
       image data is organised as interleaved scan lines from top to
       bottom  of  the  window, with UY0 and VY1 values alternating,
       with two bytes  per  value,  stored  high-order  byte  first,
       encoded  according  to the IEEE digital component video stan‐
       dard.
