Crypt implements a set of  public-key  signature  algorithms.
The public/private key pairs are represented by values of the
adt SK, containing both the private (secret) and public parts
of  the  pair,  and PK, containing only the public part.  The
several algorithms are represented by  different  pick  vari‐
ants.

GenSK generates a new public/private key pair, represented by
SK.  Algname is the name of the algorithm to use; in the cur‐
rent  implementation,  dsa,  elgamal  and  rsa  are possible.
Length gives the length of the key modulus  in  bits.   GenSK
returns nil if an unknown algorithm has been specified.

GenSKfromPK  generates  a  private  key  that  has the system
parameters as the public key pk.  It is used to generate  new
keys that are of the same complexity as old keys.

Sktopk  returns a reference to the public part of private key
sk.

Sign creates a digital signature of a message m,  represented
by  an  IPint,  using the private key sk.  Typically m repre‐
sents a secure hash  (eg,  using  crypt-sha1(2))  of  a  much
larger message.

Verify  uses  public key pk to verify that the value sig is a
digital signature of the message m using the private key cor‐
responding  to  pk.  It returns non-zero (true) if the signa‐
ture is valid; zero (false) otherwise.

Most applications use generic operations on public  and  pri‐
vate  keys, referring to PK and SK, but specific variants can
be named, such as PK.RSA for RSA keys, allowing use  of  RSA-
specific operations.  Crypt-dsagen(2) describes functions for
key generation that are specific to various algorithms, using
algorithm-specific parameters.

Dhparams  creates  Diffie-Hellman  parameters.  It  returns a
tuple of IPints (alpha,p).  P is an nbits long  prime  number
that serves as the modulus.  Alpha is a primitive root in the
integer field defined by that modulus.
