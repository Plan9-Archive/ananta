= scancode: known formats of scan codes


The *scancode* interface of _cons_(3) provides access to scan codes of
the primary keyboard. There are as many scan code formats as keyboards.
Here are some common ones.

== Microsoft Windows™ Virtual Key

The identifier is *emu_win32vk*, and each scan code is encoded in the
two byte format specified in _cons(3)_. This format is used by the
Microsoft Windows™ implementation of _emu_(1E), and each scan code is a
_Virtual Key_. See the appropriate Microsoft documentation for the
meaning of the codes.

== X11

The identifier is *emu_x11*, and each scan code is encoded in the single
byte format specified in _cons(3)_. This format is used by the various
Unix/X11 implementations of _emu_(1E), and each scan code is an X11
_keycode_. See the appropriate X11 documentation for the meaning of the
codes.
