The Ethernet device #ln serves a three-level directory repre‐
senting a physical Ethernet interface: AMD LANCE, 3Com 3C509,
3Com 3C905, Intel 82557, and others.  If n is not given it is
taken to be 0.

The top level directory has a single directory named  ethern,
where n is the interface number, starting from 0, assigned in
some platform-dependent way.  That directory contains a  con‐
versation  directory for each of 8 Ethernet packet types, and
a clone file.

Opening the clone file returns a file descriptor open on  the
ctl  file  of  an unused conversation directory.  Reading the
ctl file returns a text string representing the number of the
connection.   The connection is controlled by writing textual
commands to the associated ctl file:

connect type
       Set the type of Ethernet packets received on the  con‐
       nection;  the type is expressed as an integer constant
       (in hexadecimal if it has a leading 0x,  octal  if  it
       has   a   leading  0,  and  otherwise  decimal).   For
       instance, Ethernet packets carrying IP version  4  use
       type  0x800.   The value -1 stands for all types.  The
       value -2 causes at most the  first  64  bytes  of  all
       types of packets to be copied to the conversation.  If
       several conversations are  assigned  the  same  packet
       type, a copy of the packet is given to each.

promiscuous
       Set the interface to capture all packets regardless of
       destination address.  An interface  normally  receives
       only  packets whose destination address is that of the
       interface or is the broadcast  address,  ffffffffffff.
       The  interface  remains  promiscuous until the control
       file is closed.  The extra packets are  received  only
       by  conversations  of  the  same  type as the incoming
       packet (or of type -1).

addmulti address
       Add the given MAC multicast address to the set of mul‐
       ticast  addresses  accepted by the interface.  Address
       is a twelve digit MAC address in hexadecimal.

remmulti address
       Remove address from the  set  of  multicast  addresses
       accepted by the interface.

Incoming  Ethernet  packets  are demultiplexed by destination
address and packet type and queued for reading by the  corre‐
sponding  open  connection(s).   Each  read  of the data file
returns each packet in turn, including the  Ethernet  header.
A  read  will  terminate at packet boundaries.  Each write to
the data file causes a  packet  to  be  sent.   The  Ethernet
address  of  the interface is inserted into the packet header
as the source address.

Reading the type  file  returns  the  decimal  value  of  the
assigned Ethernet packet type.

Reading  the stats file returns status information, the value
of counters, the `promiscuous' state, and  the  Ethernet  MAC
address of the interface.

Reading the ifstats file returns statistics and status infor‐
mation specific to a given hardware interface.
