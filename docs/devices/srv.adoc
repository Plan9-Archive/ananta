    sys->bind("#sspec", "/chan", Sys->MREPL);

Srv  converts  between file system operations by applications
and messages on channels, as described  in  sys-file2chan(2).
Each  attach  that  does  not  include  a spec produces a new
instance: an empty directory owned by  the  current  user  in
which  only  files  may  be  created,  and  then only by sys-
file2chan, using a special  internal  interface.   Each  such
file  initially has the same owner as the directory, and per‐
missions 8r600 (read-write for the owner only), but the  per‐
missions  can  be changed by Sys->wstat (see sys-stat(2)) and
thus chmod(1).  If mode Sys->DMEXCL is thereby set, the  file
becomes  exclusive-use  and can be opened by only one process
at a time.  The file length and mode  bit  Sys->DMAPPEND  may
also be set by wstat but are not interpreted by the system.

Files  may be removed, directly using sys-remove(2) (and thus
rm(1)), or indirectly by opening them with mode  Sys->ORCLOSE
(see  sys-open(2)).  File2chan also removes the corresponding
file when the last references to the server's read and  write
channels have gone (eg, on server exit).

A  spec  may  be  given to name specific instances of srv, so
that a new name space  can  bind  in  a  service  created  in
another.   Only  the owner (original creator) of the instance
may attach to it, unless the mode of the service directory is
changed  using  Sys->wstat  (see sys-stat(2)) to have general
access.
