= nsbuild: build Inferno namespace


*nsbuild* [ *file* ]


*Nsbuild* builds a file name space for Inferno. It reads a _file_ (by
default, a file called *namespace* in the current directory) and
interprets the name space commands found in that file.

The commands executed by *nsbuild* include *bind* and *mount*. See
_namespace_(6) for details on the format of the file.

== FILES

*namespace*::
  The default namespace file.

== SOURCE

*/appl/cmd/nsbuild.b*

== SEE ALSO

_bind_(1), _cd_(1), _newns_(2), _namespace_(6)

== BUGS

The *new* and *fork* operations of _namespace_(6) are ineffective
because _nsbuild_ runs as a separate process.
