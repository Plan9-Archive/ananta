= mk: maintain (make) related files


*mk* [ *-f* _mkfile_ ] ... [ _option ..._ ] [ _target ..._ ]


_Mk_ uses the dependency rules specified in _mkfile_ to control the
update (usually by compilation) of _targets_ (usually files) from the
source files upon which they depend. The _mkfile_ (default

contains a _rule_ for each target that identifies the files and other
targets upon which it depends and a _sh_(1) script, a _recipe_, to
update the target. The script is run if the target does not exist or if
it is older than any of the files it depends on. _Mkfile_ may also
contain _meta-rules_ that define actions for updating implicit targets.
If no _target_ is specified, the target of the first rule (not
meta-rule) in _mkfile_ is updated.

The environment variable *$NPROC* determines how many targets may be
updated simultaneously; the default value is 1.

Options are:

*-a*::
  Assume all targets to be out of date. Thus, everything is updated.

*-d*[*egp*]::
  Produce debugging output (*p* is for parsing, *g* for graph building,
  *e* for execution).
*-e*::
  Explain why each target is made.
*-i*::
  Force any missing intermediate targets to be made.
*-k*::
  Do as much work as possible in the face of errors.
*-n*::
  Print, but do not execute, the commands needed to update the targets.
*-s*::
  Make the command line arguments sequentially rather than in parallel.
*-t*::
  Touch (update the modified date of) file targets, without executing
  any recipes.
**-w**__target1__**,**__target2,...__::
  Pretend the modify time for each _target_ is the current time; useful
  in conjunction with *-n* to learn what updates would be triggered by
  modifying the _targets_.

== The mkfile

A _mkfile_ consists of _assignments_ (described under `Environment') and
_rules_. A rule contains _targets_ and a _tail_. A target is a literal
string and is normally a file name. The tail contains zero or more
_prerequisites_ and an optional _recipe_, which is a *sh* script. Each
line of the recipe must begin with white space. A rule takes the form

....
target: prereq1 prereq2
        sh recipe using prereq1, prereq2 to build target
....

When the recipe is executed, the first character on every line is
elided.

After the colon on the target line, a rule may specify _attributes_,
described below.

A _meta-rule_ has a target of the form __A__**%**_B_ where _A_ and _B_
are (possibly empty) strings. A meta-rule acts as a rule for any
potential target whose name matches __A__**%**_B_ with *%* replaced by
an arbitrary string, called the _stem_. In interpreting a meta-rule, the
stem is substituted for all occurrences of *%* in the prerequisite
names. In the recipe of a meta-rule, the environment variable *$stem*
contains the string matched by the *%*. For example, a meta-rule to
compile a limbo program anmd install it might be:

....
%.dis:    %.b
        limbo $stem.b
	cp $stem.dis /dis
....

Meta-rules may contain an ampersand *&* rather than a percent sign *%*.
A *%* matches a maximal length string of any characters; an *&* matches
a maximal length string of any characters except period or slash.

The text of the _mkfile_ is processed as follows. Lines beginning with
*<* followed by a file name are replaced by the contents of the named
file. Blank lines and comments, which run from unquoted *#* characters
to the following newline, are deleted. The character sequence
backslash-newline is deleted, so long lines in _mkfile_ may be folded.
Non-recipe lines are processed by substituting for **`\{**__command__*}*
the output of the _command_ when run by _sh_. References to variables
are replaced by the variables' values. Special characters may be quoted
using single quotes *''* as in _sh_(1).

Assignments and rules are distinguished by the first unquoted occurrence
of *:* (rule) or *=* (assignment).

A later rule may modify or override an existing rule under the following
conditions:

-::
  If the targets of the rules exactly match and one rule contains only a
  prerequisite clause and no recipe, the clause is added to the
  prerequisites of the other rule. If either or both targets are
  virtual, the recipe is always executed.
-::
  If the targets of the rules match exactly and the prerequisites do not
  match and both rules contain recipes, _mk_ reports an ``ambiguous
  recipe'' error.
-::
  If the target and prerequisites of both rules match exactly, the
  second rule overrides the first.

== Environment

Rules may make use of *sh* environment variables. A legal reference of
the form *$OBJ* or *$\{name}* is expanded as in _sh_(1). A reference of
the form **$\{name:**__A__**%**__B__**=**__C%_D_},__ where _A, B, C, D_
are (possibly empty) strings, has the value formed by expanding *$name*
and substituting _C_ for _A_ and _D_ for _B_ in each word in *$name*
that matches pattern __A__**%**_B._

Variables can be set by assignments of the form _
var=[__attr__=]_value__ +
Blanks in the _value_ break it into words, as in _sh_ but without the
surrounding parentheses. Such variables are exported to the environment
of recipes as they are executed, unless *U*, the only legal attribute
_attr_, is present. The initial value of a variable is taken from (in
increasing order of precedence) the default values below, _mk's_
environment, the _mkfiles_, and any command line assignment as an
argument to _mk_. A variable assignment argument overrides the first
(but not any subsequent) assignment to that variable. The variable
*MKFLAGS* contains all the option arguments (arguments starting with

or containing

and *MKARGS* contains all the targets in the call to _mk_.

Dynamic information may be included in the mkfile by using a line of the
form _ <| _command_ _args__ +
This runs the command _command_ with the given arguments _args_ and
pipes its standard output to _mk_ to be included as part of the mkfile.
For instance, the file */os/sa1100/mkfile* uses this technique to run a
shell command with an awk script and a configuration file as arguments
in order for the _awk_ script to process the file and output a set of
variables and their values.

== Execution

During execution, _mk_ determines which targets must be updated, and in
what order, to build the _names_ specified on the command line. It then
runs the associated recipes.

A target is considered up to date if it has no prerequisites or if all
its prerequisites are up to date and it is newer than all its
prerequisites. Once the recipe for a target has executed, the target is
considered up to date.

The date stamp used to determine if a target is up to date is computed
differently for different types of targets. If a target is _virtual_
(the target of a rule with the *V* attribute), its date stamp is
initially zero; when the target is updated the date stamp is set to the
most recent date stamp of its prerequisites. Otherwise, if a target does
not exist as a file, its date stamp is set to the most recent date stamp
of its prerequisites, or zero if it has no prerequisites. Otherwise, the
target is the name of a file and the target's date stamp is always that
file's modification date. The date stamp is computed when the target is
needed in the execution of a rule; it is not a static value.

Nonexistent targets that have prerequisites and are themselves
prerequisites are treated specially. Such a target _t_ is given the date
stamp of its most recent prerequisite and if this causes all the targets
which have _t_ as a prerequisite to be up to date, _t_ is considered up
to date. Otherwise, _t_ is made in the normal fashion. The *-i* flag
overrides this special treatment.

Files may be made in any order that respects the preceding restrictions.

A recipe is executed by supplying the recipe as standard input to the
command * $SHELL -e -I* +
where the _SHELL_ variable is the appropriate shell on the current
platform - typically */dis/sh* The appropriate value is automatically
supplied in the Inferno build environment. The *-e* is omitted if the
*E* attribute is set. The environment is augmented by the following
variables:

*$alltarget*::
  all the targets of this rule.
*$newprereq*::
  the prerequisites that caused this rule to execute.
*$nproc*::
  the process slot for this recipe. It satisfies
  0â‰¤**$nproc**<**$NPROC**.
*$pid*::
  the process id for the _mk_ executing the recipe.
*$prereq*::
  all the prerequisites for this rule.
*$stem*::
  if this is a meta-rule, *$stem* is the string that matched *%* or *&*.
  Otherwise, it is empty. For regular expression meta-rules (see below),
  the variables

are set to the corresponding subexpressions.

*$target*::
  the targets for this rule that need to be remade.

These variables are available only during the execution of a recipe, not
while evaluating the _mkfile_.

Unless the rule has the *Q* attribute, the recipe is printed prior to
execution with recognizable environment variables expanded. Commands
returning error status cause _mk_ to terminate.

Recipes and backquoted *sh* commands in places such as assignments
execute in a copy of _mk's_ environment; changes they make to
environment variables are not visible from _mk_.

Variable substitution in a rule is done when the rule is read; variable
substitution in the recipe is done when the recipe is executed. For
example:

....
bar=a.b
foo:    $bar
        limbo -o foo $bar
bar=b.b
....

will compile *b.b* into *foo*, if *a.b* is newer than *foo*.

== Aggregates

Names of the form _a_(_b_) refer to member _b_ of the aggregate _a_.
Currently, there are no aggregates supported under Inferno.

== Attributes

The colon separating the target from the prerequisites may be
immediately followed by _attributes_ and another colon. The attributes
are:

*D*::
  If the recipe exits with a non-null status, the target is deleted.
*E*::
  Continue execution if the recipe draws errors.
*N*::
  If there is no recipe, the target has its time updated.
*n*::
  The rule is a meta-rule that cannot be a target of a virtual rule.
  Only files match the pattern in the target.
*P*::
  The characters after the *P* until the terminating *:* are taken as a
  program name. It will be invoked as *sh -c prog 'arg1' 'arg2'* and
  should return a null exit status if and only if arg1 is not out of
  date with respect to arg2. Date stamps are still propagated in the
  normal way.
*Q*::
  The recipe is not printed prior to execution.
*R*::
  The rule is a meta-rule using regular expressions. In the rule, *%*
  has no special meaning. The target is interpreted as a regular
  expression as defined in _regexp_(6). The prerequisites may contain
  references to subexpressions in form **\**__n,__ as in the substitute
  command of _sed_(1).
*U*::
  The targets are considered to have been updated even if the recipe did
  not do so.
*V*::
  The targets of this rule are marked as virtual. They are distinct from
  files of the same name.

== EXAMPLES

A simple mkfile to compile and install limbo programs:

....
O=dis
prog:   a.$O b.$O c.$O
    cp $prereq /dis

%.$O:   %.b
    limbo $stem.b
....

String expression variables to derive names from a master list:

....
NAMES=alloc arc bquote builtins expand main match mk var word
OBJ=${NAMES:%=%.$O}
....

Regular expression meta-rules:

....
([^/]*)/(.*)\.dis:R:  \1/\2.b
	cd $stem1; limbo $stem2.b
....

== BUGS

Identical recipes for regular expression meta-rules only have one
target. +
The recipes printed by _mk_ before being passed to _sh_ for execution
are sometimes erroneously expanded for printing. Don't trust what's
printed; rely on what _sh_ does.
