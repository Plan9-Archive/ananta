_Auplay_ plays each _file_ in turn on the audio device */dev/audio* (see
_audio_(3)), setting the device's characteristics in */dev/audioctl* to
match those of the _file_. It uses _stream_ (see _sys-read_(2)) to
stream the data to the device at high priority. All files played must be
in `Inferno audio format', as defined by _audio_(6).

_Auhdr_ writes the header of each Inferno audio _input_ file to the
standard output. The header describes the data in a form that can be
written directly to */dev/audioctl* to set the device's characteristics.

_Raw2iaf_ converts the _input_ file, adds an appropriate header to
describe the data in the Inferno format, and writes the result to the
_output_ file. The options tell how the bytes in the input file should
be interpreted:

*-8*::
  rate is 8000 Hz
*-1*::
  rate is 11025 Hz
*-2*::
  rate is 22050 Hz
*-4*::
  rate is 44100 Hz
*-m*::
  mono (one channel)
*-s*::
  stereo (two channels)
*-b*::
  each sample in each channel is one byte (unsigned)
*-w*::
  each sample in each channel is 16-bits (little-endian)
*-a*::
  input is a-law encoded
*-u*::
  input is Î¼-law encoded
*-p*::
  input is PCM encoded

_Wav2iaf_ reads the _input_ file, which must be in Windows WAV format
and encoded using PCM, and converts the data to Inferno format on the
standard output.
