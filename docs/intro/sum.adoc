= sum, md5sum, sha1sum: calculate file's checksum


*sum* _file_ ...

*md5sum* [ _file ..._ ]


_Sum_ prints the 32-bit checksum (actually a CRC), length in bytes, and
name of each _file_, one per line. It ignores directories.

_Md5sum_ prints the MD5 message digest (as 32 hexadecimal digits) and
the name of each _file_, separated by a tab, one per line. If no files
are given, the standard input is read.

_Sha1sum_ is similar, but uses the US National Institute of Standards
and Technology's secure hash algorithm SHA1 instead of MD5. For each
_file_, it prints its SHA1 secure hash (as 40 hexadecimal digits) and
the file's name, separated by a tab, one per line. If no files are
given, _sha1sum_ reads the standard input.
