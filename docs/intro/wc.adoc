= wc: count lines, words, and characters


*wc* [ *-lwceb* ] [ _file ..._ ]


_Wc_ writes to standard output a tally of lines, words, and characters
found in each _file_, assumed to be text in UTF format. If no files are
named, standard input is read. One line is output per file. If several
files are specified, an additional line is written giving totals.

`Words' are maximal sequences of characters separated by blanks, tabs
and newlines.

Counts are output in the same order as the listing of the option letters
*lwceb*; select lines, words, UTF characters, erroneously-encoded
characters, and bytes, respectively. If no options are given, lines,
words and characters are counted.
