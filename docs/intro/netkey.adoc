= netkey: calculate response to authentication challenge


*netkey*


_Netkey_ calculates a response to a challenge made by a system to
authenticate a user, based on a shared secret (password), using the same
algorithm as a SecureNet device. It reads and writes */dev/cons*. It
prompts once for the secret (echo is turned off). It then repeatedly
prompts for a remote system's challenge, and once given it, calculates
and prints the corresponding response. It exits on an empty challenge or
end of file.
