= mkdir: make a directory


*mkdir* [ *-p* ] [ _dirname ..._ ]


_Mkdir_ creates the specified directories. It requires write permission
in the parent directory.

The *-p* option causes _mkdir_ to create the whole path _dirname_,
including any missing parent directories; it also will not complain if
_dirname_ already exists and is a directory.

The new directories are created with permissions starting with *8r777*
but masked with the permissions of the parent directory according to the
procedure followed by _sys-open_(2). For example, if the parent
directory lacks write permission for group and has no permissions for
others, so will the newly created directory.
