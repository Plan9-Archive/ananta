= join: join a spree clique.


*spree/join* [ *-d* _mntdir_ ] [ *-j* _joinrequest_ ] _name_


When a _spree_(4) instance has been mounted from somewhere on the
network, *join* can be used to join a clique and fire up the appropriate
module to perform the client-side display. _Mntdir_ gives the directory
where the spree instance is mounted (default */n/remote*); _joinrequest_
gives the initial join request to be passed to the clique (default
_join_). _Name_ is the name of the clique's directory within the spree
directory.

== EXAMPLE

When spree is started, it creates a ``lobby'' engine that keeps a record
of what cliques have been started, who is a member of which, etc.
