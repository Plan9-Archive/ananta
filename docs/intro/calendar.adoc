= calendar: calendar and diary

[source,subs=quotes]
----
*wm/calendar* [ __mntdir__|_datafile_ ] +
----

*Calendar* is a simple calendar and diary program. Its optional argument
specifies either a directory on which has been mounted a _rawdbfs_ (see
_dbfs_(4)) filesystem, or a file in which to store schedule entries
(which must already exist). In the latter case, _calendar_ starts up an
instance of _rawdbfs_ to serve the file. The default argument to
_calendar_ is */mnt/schedule*. If two instances of calendar are using
the same datafile, care should be taken to run _rawdbfs_ _before_
running the _calendar_ programs, otherwise the data file will be
corrupted.

== EXAMPLE

Start _calendar_ using *$home/cal* for the data entries:

....
	rawdbfs $home/cal /mnt/schedule
	wm/calendar
....
