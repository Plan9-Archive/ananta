----

_Asm_ reads one Dis assembly language _file_ and translates it into
instructions for the Dis virtual machine. The output is written to a
file whose name is created by taking the last element of the input file,
stripping any extension, and appending *.dis* For example, the output
file for *abc* would be *abc.dis*; the output file for *dir/def.s*,
would be *def.dis*.

The assembler has one option:

*-l*::
  Generate a listing, showing the generated object code.

_Disdump_ prints to the standard output the Dis virtual machine
instructions in each of its Dis _file_ arguments.
