= echo: print arguments


*echo* [*-n*] [_arg ..._]

*load echo* +
*echo* [*-n*] [_arg ..._]


_Echo_ writes its arguments separated by blanks and terminated by a
newline on the standard output. Option *-n* suppresses the newline.

A version of _echo_ can optionally be loaded into the Shell _sh_(1) if
need be, to make shell scripts a little faster.
