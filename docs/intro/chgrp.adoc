= chgrp: change file's group or owner


*chgrp* [ *-uo* ] _id_ _file ..._


_Chgrp_ changes the group ownership of each _file_ to the given _id_, if
the file's server permits it. The *-u* and *-o* options are equivalent
and cause _chgrp_ to change file ownership instead, if the file's server
permits it.

Normally, a file's group can be changed by the file's owner, if the
owner is a member of the new group, or by the leader of both the file's
current group and the new group, but various underlying devices, file
servers and host operating systems might not permit the operation at
all. Group and ownership changes allowed by a given device are
documented by the device's manual page. See _sys-stat_(2) for the
variations amongst host operating systems.
