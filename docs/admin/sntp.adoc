= sntp: simple network time protocol client

== SYNOPSIS

*ip/sntp* [ *-di* ] [ _server_ ]


_Sntp_ is a simple client for the Simple Network Time Protocol
(RFC1361). It requests the time from the SNTP service on _server_
(default: *udp!$ntp!ntp*), and if it receives a plausible reply, sets
the local time accordingly, in both _rtc_(3) and */dev/time*. The *-d*
option prints debugging text, including the time received; the *-i*
option stops _sntp_ from actually updating the local time.
