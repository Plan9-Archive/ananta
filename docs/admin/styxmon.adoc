= styxmon: monitor a 9P (Styx) conversation

== SYNOPSIS

*styxmon* [ *-r* ] [ *-t* ] _cmd_ [ _arg_... ]


_Styxmon_ allows the monitoring of 9P messages sent and received by
_cmd_, which should serve 9P through its standard input. _Styxmon_ in
its turn serves 9P through its standard input, and writes information on
the 9P messages that it sees to the standard error. The *-r* and *-t*
options restrict the messages printed to R-messages and T-messages
respectively.

== EXAMPLE

Mount an instance of _export_(4) of the current name space through
_styxmon_ on */n/remote* to monitor all access to it through that name:

....
mount {styxmon {export /}} /n/remote
ls /n/remote
cp /n/remote/lib/unicode /n/remote/dev/null
....
