= fpgaload: configure FPGA

== SYNOPSIS

*auxi/fpgaload* [ **-c**__ clk__ ] _file.rbf_


_Fpgaload_ configures the directly-attached Altera Flex6000 FPGA on the
Bright Star Engineering ip-Engine. It enables the FPGA and output of the
external system clocks, then loads the FPGA with the contents of
_file.rbf_ which should be in the `raw binary format' produced for
example by the Altera tools. After successful configuration, the BCLK is
set to _clk_ MHz; _clk_ must be a divisor of the ip-Engine's system
clock (currently 48 MHz).
