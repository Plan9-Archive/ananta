= mangaload: send new kernel to MANGA bootstrap

== SYNOPSIS

*auxi/mangaload* [ *-48dr* ] _host_ _image_


_Mangaload_ uses an ICMP protocol unique to the Peplink MANGAâ„¢ firewall
to send a new kernel _image_ to the MANGA bootstrap monitor to burn into
flash, replacing the existing kernel image. To start the loading
process, connect to the device's console on its serial port (38400 baud,
8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control), power the device off
then on again, and when the *MANGA* prompt appears, quickly type the
letter *f*. Then run _mangaload_ to load the kernel; the device should
give status updates as the kernel loads, and as it burns the image into
flash. When it has finished, power the device off and on again to start
the new kernel.

By default, _mangaload_ assumes a 4 Mbyte flash on the device; the *-8*
option sets it to 8 Mbytes. The *-r* option causes the _image_ to be
loaded into another, larger flash region, used by Linux for its initial
root, which can be used by Inferno for general storage. The *-d* option
prints a trace of the protocol, for debugging.
