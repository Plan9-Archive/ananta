= slip: SLIP data framing protocol

    init:  fn();
    start: fn(param: string): chan of ref Rq;

Slip  provides  the  SLIP  data framing protocol described by
RFC1055.  The module is  an  implementation  of  the  general
data-processing module type Filter; see filter(2) for details
of that general interface.

Init must be called before any other operation of the module.

Start begins SLIP line encoding or decoding via  the  channel
it  returns,  following  the protocol of filter(2).  Param is
one of the two following strings:

encode The filter takes the block of data  obtained  by  each
       Rq.Fill message, adds framing and escape characters as
       required, and returns the resulting data block  in  an
       Rq.Result message.

decode The filter operates on the data in Rq.Fill messages as
       a single stream of bytes, providing an Rq.Result  mes‚Äê
       sage for each framed message found in the stream, with
       escape characters processed to retrieve  the  original
       data.
