= volume: volume control for an infrared interface

    include "volume.m";
    vctl := load Volumectl Volumectl->PATH;

    volumectl: fn(ctxt: ref Draw->Context, ch: chan of int,
                   device: string);

Volumectl  should  be  spawned as a separate process from any
process that desires volume control via  an  infrared  inter‚Äê
face.  Ctxt provides volumectl with access to the display, on
which it displays a slider widget.  The slider  automatically
disappears  after  several  seconds of inactivity.  Volumectl
receives input from the infrared controller  on  channel  ch.
The values recognized are:

VolUP  increase volume

VolDN  decrease volume

Enter  exit

Device  is  a  string  used  as  a  prefix to commands to the
device; for example "audio out" for audio(3).
