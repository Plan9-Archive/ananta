= styxflush: handler for 9P (Styx) flush protocol

    init: fn();
    tmsg: fn(m: ref Styx->Tmsg,
         flushc: chan of (int, chan of int),

Getting  the  semantics  of  the 9P flush(5) protocol correct
when handling requests concurrently is surprisingly  hard  to
do.   Styxflush  is  designed  to help get it right. It deals
= with 9P messages for a single 9P session: if a server  needs
to  deal  with  multiple sessions, then multiple instances of
styxflush should be loaded. It assumes there is a loop  in  a
central process that both reads T-messages and sends their R-
message replies.  Styxflush handles the flushing of  requests
that are being run outside the central process.

Init  must  be  called  before  anything else in styxflush to
intialise its internal data structures.

When a T-message request arrives that will be dealt with con‐
currently,  tmsg(m, flushc, reply) should be called to inform
styxflush of the new request.  M gives the T-message;  flushc
gives  a  channel that will be used if the request is flushed
(see below), and reply should hold an unbuffered channel that
can be used to send a reply to the central loop.  Flushc will
usually be a fresh channel  for  each  request,  but  several
requests  may  share  the  same  flushc if, for instance, one
process is managing several requests.  Tmsg returns  a  tuple
(handled, rm),  where  handled  is  non-zero if styxflush has
dealt with the request itself. If it  has,  then  the  caller
must not handle the request; it must send rm as a reply if it
is not nil.

Rmsg should be called when a reply  message  arrives  at  the
central  process (the same process that has called tmsg).  It
returns non-zero if the reply message should actually be sent
= to the client: otherwise it should be discarded.

   Flush Channel
Styxflush  notifies  a  request  that  it has been flushed by
sending a tuple, say (tag, rc) on  its  flush  channel.   Tag
gives the tag of the message that has been flushed, and rc is
a channel that should be replied on when the request has been
dealt  with.  There  is no requirement that a request read on
= its flush channel: if it does not, then the replies  to  any
flushes  of that request will be delayed until the request is
replied to.  If it does read a  flush  request,  however,  it
must  reply to the original request before sending on rc.  If
it has succeeded in aborting the request, it should  send  an
error(5)  R-message  with the message interrupted (defined as
Einterrupted); otherwise it should send its reply as usual.

== example
This is a skeleton of a prototypical structure of  a  program
that uses styxflush.
replyc: chan of ref Rmsg;
centralloop(tm: chan of ref Tmsg, fd: ref Sys->FD)
{
     replyc = chan of Rmsg;
     for(;;)alt{
     m := <-tm =>
          if(m == nil || tagof m == tagof Tmsg.Readerror){
               cleanup();          # kill outstanding processes, etc.
               return;
          }
          flushc := chan of (int, chan of int);
          (handled, rm) := styxflush->tmsg(m, flushc, replyc);
          if(!handled)
               spawn request(m, flushc);
          else if(rm != nil)
               sendreply(rm);
     rm := <- replyc =>
          if(styxflush->rmsg(rm))
               sendreply(rm);
     }
}

sendreply(fd: ref Sys->FD, rm: ref Rmsg)
{
     d := rm.pack();
     sys->write(fd, d, len d);
}

request(tm: ref Tmsg, flushc: chan of (int, chan of int))
{
     pick m := tm {
     Open =>
          replyc <-= ref Rmsg.Open(m.tag, ...);
     Read =>
          [...]
          alt{
          x := <-readc =>
               # read from data produced on readc
               replyc <-= ref Rmsg.Read(m.tag, ...);
          (nil, rc) := <-flushc =>
               # read request has been flushed.
               replyc <-= ref Rmsg.Error(m.tag, Einterrupted);
               rc <-= 1;
          }
     etc ...
     }
}
