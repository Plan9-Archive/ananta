SYNOPSIS
       cursor ?options?

INTRODUCTION
       Cursor changes the image displayed at the current mouse posi‐
       tion.  The following options are supported:

       -image image
              Image gives a name created using the image(9) command;
              the  image  must  conform  to the rules given for Dis‐
              play.cursor (see draw-display(2)).

       -bitmap bitmap
              Similar to -image but using  the  bitmap  syntax  (see
              types(9)).

       -x dist
              The  cursor  will  be  drawn  dist to the right of the
              actual position of the mouse.

       -y dist
              The cursor will be drawn dist below the  actual  posi‐
              tion of the mouse.

       -default
              Revert the cursor to its default image.

BUGS
       A cursor image should have some inherent association with its
       hot-spot offset.
