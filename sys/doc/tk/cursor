= cursor: change the current mouse cursor

    cursor ?options?

== introduction
Cursor changes the image displayed at the current mouse posi‐
tion.  The following options are supported:

-image image
       Image gives a name created using the image(9) command;
       the  image  must  conform  to the rules given for Dis‐
       play.cursor (see draw-display(2)).

-bitmap bitmap
       Similar to -image but using  the  bitmap  syntax  (see
       types(9)).

-x dist
       The  cursor  will  be  drawn  dist to the right of the
       actual position of the mouse.

-y dist
       The cursor will be drawn dist below the  actual  posi‐
       tion of the mouse.

-default
       Revert the cursor to its default image.

== bugs
A cursor image should have some inherent association with its
hot-spot offset.
