UPDATE(9)             Kernel Developer's Manual            UPDATE(9)

NAME
       update - flush graphics

SYNOPSIS
       update ?options?

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  made  via  Tk commands do not become visible until a
       call to update.  Update flushes any pending  changes  to  the
       screen.  The following options are supported:

       -disable
              If  this  option  is  given, all updates are disabled.
              This is useful to enable a program to stop mouse move‚Äê
              ment  causing  automatic  updates  while  it is making
              changes to the window.

       -enable
              This reverses a previous update -enable invocation.

BUGS
       Changes that affect window sizes are visible immediately.
