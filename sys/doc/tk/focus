= focus: change or query keyboard focus

    focus ?what?

With  no  arguments,  focus returns the name of the widget to
which keyboard events are currently delivered, known  as  the
keyboard  focus.   When  given an argument, focus changes the
keyboard focus.  If what is the name of a widget, that widget
will  be  made the keyboard focus.  If what is next, the key‚Äê
board focus will be changed to the next  item  in  the  focus
order  for  that  window.  If  what is previous, the keyboard
focus will be changed to the previous item in the focus order
for  that window. The focus order is determined automatically
by Tk.
