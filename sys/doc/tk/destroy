= destroy: Destroy one or more windows

    destroy ?window window ...?

This  command  deletes  the windows given by the window argu‐
ments, plus  all  of  their  descendants.   The  windows  are
destroyed  in  order,  and if an error occurs in destroying a
window the command aborts without  destroying  the  remaining
windows.

The Destroy event is fired for each window destroyed, includ‐
ing descendants.

If the window ``.'' is specified, it is unmapped rather  than
destroyed and the Destroy event is not fired on it.  However,
all of its decendants are destroyed as normal.
