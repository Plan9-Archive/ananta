VARIABLE(9)           Kernel Developer's Manual          VARIABLE(9)

NAME
       variable - interrogate a button variable

SYNOPSIS
       variable var ?value?

DESCRIPTION
       Variable  queries  or  sets  the  value  of a Tk radiobutton,
       checkbutton or choicebutton variable.   An  error  diagnostic
       will be returned if the variable is of the wrong type (if for
       instance it is the name of a named channel).

       If value is given, the value of the variable is set  to  that
       value,  and  any associated buttons will subsequently reflect
       this  in  their  appearance.   Omitting  the  value  argument
       returns the current value of the variable.

       The  special variable lasterror holds the text of the last Tk
       error encountered.  It resets when queried.
