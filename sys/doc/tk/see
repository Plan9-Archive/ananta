= see: Make a portion of a widget visible.

    see option ?pathName?

See  makes  sure that a portion of a widget is visible in its
containing view; for instance, it will  scroll  a  canvas  or
text  widget to ensure that the specified portion is in view.
The following options are supported:

-rectangle  list
       Specifies a list with four dist coordinates describing
       the  left,  top,  right, and bottom coordinates of the
       rectangular region, in  coordinates  relative  to  the
       widget  origin,  of the area that should be made visi‚Äê
       ble.

-point listP
       Specifies a list with two dist coordinates  describing
       a  point within the widget that should be made visible
       by preference if the entirety of  the  above-specified
       rectangle cannot be shown. Defaults to the top left of
       the specified rectangle.

-where If this option is given, see returns a list containing
       the  left,  top,  right  and bottom coordinates of the
       currently visible portion of pathName.

If neither the -rectangle or the -point  options  are  given,
then the entire area of pathName will be made visible.
