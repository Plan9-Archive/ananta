= variable: interrogate a button variable

    variable var ?value?

Variable  queries  or  sets  the  value  of a Tk radiobutton,
checkbutton or choicebutton variable.   An  error  diagnostic
will be returned if the variable is of the wrong type (if for
instance it is the name of a named channel).

If value is given, the value of the variable is set  to  that
value,  and  any associated buttons will subsequently reflect
this  in  their  appearance.   Omitting  the  value  argument
returns the current value of the variable.

The  special variable lasterror holds the text of the last Tk
error encountered.  It resets when queried.
