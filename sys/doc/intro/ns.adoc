= ns: display current namespace


*ns* [ *-r* ] [ _pid_ ]


_Ns_ displays the construction of the namespace of the given _pid_, or
its own (as inherited) by default. Based on the contents of
**/prog/**__pid__**/ns**__,__ it prints on standard output a sequence of
bind and mount commands (see _bind_(1)) that might reconstruct the same
name space if executed. In practice, mounts of services such as
_ftpfs_(4) often refer to the names of pipe ends that are now
inaccessible. Furthermore, if any file involved has been renamed since
the mount or bind, the original name of the file is shown.

Mounts of file services on a network show the network address as given
to _dial_(2) instead of the name of the data file for the connection;
the *-r* option causes _ns_ to show the raw file name instead.
