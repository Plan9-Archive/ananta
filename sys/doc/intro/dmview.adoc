= dmview, dmwm: view remote displays


*wm/dmview* _address_

*wm/dmwm* [ **-p**__ port__ ]


_Dmwm_ is run in place of the usual Inferno window manager _wm_(1), to
allow the display's contents to be viewed elsewhere. _Dmwm_ waits for
incoming viewing requests on the given TCP/IP _port_ (default: 9998). On
each connection attempt, _dmwm_ prompts the user to accept or reject the
request for a remote view.

_Dmview_ opens a connection to an instance of _dmwm_ at the given
network _address_ and, if the remote user accepts the connection, opens
a new window on _dmview_'s own display that contains a replica of the
remote display.
