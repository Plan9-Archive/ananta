= netstat: summarize network connections


*netstat*


_Netstat_ prints information about network connections. The following is
presented for each connection:

__________________________________________________________________________________
connection name: the protocol and conversation directory in */net* (eg.
*tcp/8*) +
user name +
status of the connection +
address of each end of the connection (eg host and port if IP)
__________________________________________________________________________________

The information is obtained from the *status* file of each entry under
the network directories */net/tcp*, */net/udp* and */net/il*.

_Netstat_ relies on a populated */net* directory; the *#I* device must
therefore have previously been bound there.
