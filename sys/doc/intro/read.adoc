= read: read from standard input with optional seek


*read* [ *-*[*eor*] _offset_ ] [ _count_ ]


_Read_ does a single read of _count_ bytes (default: 8192 bytes) from
the standard input and writes the result to the standard output. If the
optional _offset_ argument is given, _read_ will first apply
_sys-seek_(2):

**-o**__ offset__::
  seek _offset_ bytes from the start of the file
**-e**__ offset__::
  seek _offset_ bytes from the end of the file
**-r**__ offset__::
  seek _offset_ bytes from the standard input's current file offset

In all cases the file offset changes to reflect the result of the seek,
and the number of bytes read.

== DIAGNOSTICS

_Read_ prints a diagnostic and returns a non-empty exit status

on an I/O error; it quietly returns status

if the read returns zero bytes (conventionally, end of file).
