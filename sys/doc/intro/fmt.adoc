= fmt: simple text formatter


*fmt* [ **-l**__ n__ ] [ **-i**__ n__ ] [ *-j* ] [ _file ..._ ]


_Fmt_ copies the given _files_ (standard input by default) to its
standard output, filling and indenting lines. The options are

**-l**__"__*n*::
  Output line length is _n_, including indent (default 70).
**-w**__"__*n*::
  A synonym for *-l*.
**-i**__"__*n*::
  Indent _n_ spaces (default 0).
*-j*::
  Do not join short lines: only fold long lines.

Empty lines and initial white space in input lines are preserved. Empty
lines are inserted between input files.

_Fmt_ is idempotent: it leaves already formatted text unchanged.
