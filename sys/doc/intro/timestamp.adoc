= timestamp: log event times


*timestamp* [ _tag_ ]


_Timestamp_ reads lines from its standard input and writes them to its
standard output, prefixing each line with the time that it was written,
in decimal milliseconds since _timestamp_ was started. If _tag_ is
given, it is written along with the time stamp on each line, to enable
tagging if several writers are each writing to the same log file.

The first line written gives the time that _timestamp_ was started, in
milliseconds since the epoch. Note that logging events can cause timings
to change, and that the timestamps are only as accurate as the times
reported by */dev/time*.
