= grep: pattern matching


*grep* [ *-lnviLs* ] _pattern_ [ _file_... ]


*Grep* prints lines from each _file_ that match the _pattern_, a regular
expression as defined in _regex_(2). If no files are given, standard
input is used. If more than one file is given, each line of output is
preceded by the name of the file it was found in. The options are:

*-l*::
  Print only the name of each file that contains a match.
*-L*::
  Print the name of each file that does not contain a match.
*-n*::
  Precede each line of output with its line number.
*-v*::
  Print only lines that do not match _pattern_.
*-i*::
  Pattern matching is case insensitive (roman letters only).
*-s*::
  Do not print anything; yield only the exit status.
