= cmp: compare two files


*cmp* [ *-lsL* ] _file1 file2_ [ _offset1_ [ _offset2_ ] ]


The two files are compared. A diagnostic results if the contents differ,
otherwise there is no output. By default, *cmp* prints the byte number
of the first differing byte.

The options are:

*-l*::
  Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing bytes (hexadecimal)
  for each difference.
*-s*::
  Print nothing for differing files, but set the exit status.
*-L*::
  Print the line number of the first differing byte.

If offsets are given, comparison starts at the designated byte position
of the corresponding file. Offsets that begin with *0x* are hexadecimal;
with *0*, octal; with anything else, decimal.
