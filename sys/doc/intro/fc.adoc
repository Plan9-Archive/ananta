= fc: command-line floating point calculator


*fc* [ _base_ ] _expression_ +


*Fc* calculates the result of its argument _expression_ and prints the
result in the format indicated by the optional base argument. _Base_ can
be one of:

*-d*::
  Decimal, as produced by the *%g* format of _sys-print_(2). +
*-x*::
  Hexadecimal, prefixed with *0x*.
*-o*::
  Octal, prefixed with *0*.
*-b*::
  Binary, prefixed with *0b*.
*-B*::
  As *-b*, but with extra lines to help bit-counting.
**-r **__radix__::
  In base _radix_, prefixed with __``radix__**r'',** as understood by
  Limbo (e.g. *16r3fff*).
*-c*::
  As a unicode character, prefixed with *@*.

_Expression_ is in reverse polish notation: each command line argument
is either an operand (number) or an operator. Operands are pushed on a
stack; operators pop items from the stack (the number of items depends
on the operator) and push their result. All operands are converted to
double precision floating point numbers before being pushed. Integer
operations convert their operands to big (64-bit) integers. When all
arguments are exhausted, all the values currently on the stack are
printed, first-pushed first, in the specified output format.

Operands can be given in any of the formats that _fc_ can print, as
detailed above.

When an operation is not commutative, the argument values will be taken
from the stack first-pushed first. Most functions from from
_math-elem_(2), _math-fp(2)_ are provided. In addition, other provided
operators include:

*+ - / x*::
  Representing the four rules. Note the use of *x* rather than ***, to
  avoid clashes with shell metacharacters. +
*xx*::
  To the power. (equivelant to 'pow') +
*rad deg*::
  Convert value to or from radians. +
!::
  Factorial. +
*_*::
  Unary minus. +
*and or xor not*::
  Bitwise operations. +
*shl shr*::
  Bitwise shift left/right.
*p*::
  Print the current top value on the stack. +
*sum*::
  Sum all the values currently pushed on the stack. +
*swap*::
  Swap the top two stack items. +
*dup*::
  Duplicate the top item on the stack. +
*rep*::
  Repeatedly execute the last operator until there is only only one item
  left on the stack. This is only valid for operators that take exactly
  two arguments.

A few symbolic names for operands are recognised, including *pi* (or
*Ï€*), *e*, and *macheps*.

fc -b 1 2 3 4 sum

....
	gives 0b00001010
....

fc 10 0b10 010 0x10 x rep 0xa00 swap -

	gives a usage summary, including a list of
	the names of all the operators.

== DIAGNOSTICS

An error message is displayed if an operator is called on a stack with
too few elements. This also causes _fc_ to yield a non-null exit status.

== BUGS

The *-B* option will only work for fixed-width fonts.
