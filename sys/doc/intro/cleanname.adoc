= cleanname: clean a path name


*cleanname* [ **-d**__ dir__ ] _name_ ...


_Cleanname_ tidies up each file _name_ it is given and prints the result
on standard output. It removes redundant slashes and interprets

and

directory names lexically. If the *-d* option is given, each _name_ that
does not not start with */* or *#* will be prefixed by __dir__**/**
before processing.
