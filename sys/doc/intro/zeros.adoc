= zeros: write sequence of bytes



*zeros* [ _-r_ ] [ __-v__value ] [ [ _blocksize_... [ _numblocks_ ] ]


*Zeros* writes a sequence of bytes to standard output. The arguments
specify the nature of the bytes, block size in bytes, and the number of
blocks to output. The _-r_ option requests that each block be the same,
but randomly generated. The __-v__value option sets the value of each
byte (default 0). Typically _zeros_ has a specialised use: ensuring a
file has the desired number of blocks in it to hold a file system image,
before reaming it.

== EXAMPLE

To create and initialize a file system containing 2048 1024 byte blocks

....
zeros 1024 2048 >kfs.file
mount -c {disk/kfs -r kfs.file} /n/local
....
