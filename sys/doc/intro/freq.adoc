= freq: print histogram of character frequencies


*freq* [ *-dxocr* ] [ _file ..._ ]


_Freq_ reads the given files (default standard input) and prints
histograms of the character frequencies. By default, _freq_ counts the
value of each byte; under the *-r* option it instead counts

byte sequences, that is, runes.

Each non-zero entry of the table is printed preceded by the byte value,
in decimal, octal, hex, and Unicode character (if printable). If any
options are given, the *-d*, *-x*, *-o*, *-c* flags specify a subset of
value formats: decimal, hex, octal, and character, respectively.
