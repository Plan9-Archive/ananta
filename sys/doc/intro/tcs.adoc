= tcs: translate character sets


*tcs* *-l* [*-v*] [ _csname_ ]

*tcs* [ *-f* _ics_ ] [ *-t* _ocs_ ] [ _file ..._ ]


_Tcs_ converts its input from the _ics_ character set encoding into
Unicode runes and then outputs the data in the encoding of the _ocs_
character set. The default values of _ics_ and _ocs_ are both *utf8*.
This is the standard Inferno Unicode text encoding as described by
_utf_(6). If no files are specified _tcs_ reads from its standard input.

The *-l* option causes _tcs_ to output the list of character sets that
it understands. The *-v* option causes a more detailed listing to be
given. Giving a _csname_ argument to the *-l* option causes _tcs_ to
list the known aliases for that name. The first name in the list is the
standard (or preferred) name.
