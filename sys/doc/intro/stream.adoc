= stream: stream data between source and sink


*stream* [*-a*] [*-b* _bufsize_] _file1_ [ _file2_ ]


_Stream_ creates a process that uses _stream_ (see _sys-read_(2)) to
stream data in chunks of at most _bufsize_ bytes (default:

or 8192 bytes) from _file1_ to the standard output. If _file2_ is
provided, the two files are instead cross-connected by two streaming
processes: one process streams data from _file1_ to _file2_, and the
other streams data from _file2_ to _file1_. In all cases, _stream_
writes data to the destination file in full buffers of _bufsize_ bytes.

_Stream_ waits for all streaming processes to stop before returning,
unless the *-a* (asynchronous) option is given, which causes it to
return after spawning the streamers.
