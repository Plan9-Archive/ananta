= report: shell module for test reporting.

*report* _severity verbosity message[...]_ +


*Its* is a loadable module for _sh_(1) that provides a simple error
reporting facility for tests which can be run by _itest_(1)_._ It
provides one command, *report*, which is used by a test to report a
message with specified severity and verbosity. _Severity_ must be one of
INF, WRN, ERR or FTL for Information, warnings, errors and fatal errors
respectively. _Verbosity_ is an integer between 0 and 9. For informatory
messages (severity INF), the message will only be displayed if the
current verbosity level is greater than or equal to _verbosity._
