= sort: sort file


*sort* [ *-nr* ] [ _file_ ]


_Sort_ sorts the lines of _file_ (default: standard input) and writes
the sorted output to standard output.

Whole lines are sorted into increasing order, using lexicographic
ordering of Unicode characters by default. The sort is stable, so that
lines that compare equal will appear in the output in the same order as
in the original file. The sort order is affected by the following
options:

*-n*::
  Each line is assumed to have an initial numeric string representing an
  integer, with optional plus or minus sign, and the lines are sorted by
  those numeric values into increasing order.
*-r*::
  Reverses the sense of comparisons.

== BUGS

The entire file is read into memory to be sorted.
