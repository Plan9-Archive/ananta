= logwindow: window that pops up when data becomes available.


*wm/logwindow* [_title_] **<**__logfile__


_Logwindow_ reads data from its standard input (often a file served by
_logfile_(4)) and shows it in a text widget. If the window is hidden (it
is hidden initially), it will reappear when data appears on its standard
input. If _title_ is given, it will be used as the title of the window.
