= cal: print calendar

[source,subs=quotes]
----
*cal* [ _month_ ] [ _year_ ]
----

_Cal_ prints a calendar. _Month_ is either a number from 1 to 12, a
lower case month name, or a lower case three-letter prefix of a month
name. _Year_ can be between 1 and 9999. If either _month_ or _year_ is
omitted, the current month or year is used. If only one argument is
given, and it is a number larger than 12, a calendar for all twelve
months of the given year is produced; otherwise a calendar for just one
month is printed. The calendar produced is that for England and her
colonies.

Try

....
cal sep 1752

The year is always considered to start in January even though this is
historically naive. +
