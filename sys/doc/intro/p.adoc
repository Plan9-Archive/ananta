= p: paginate


*p* [ **-**__number__ ] [ _file ..._ ]


_P_ copies its standard input, or the named files if given, to its
standard output, stopping at the end of every page, to wait for a
newline from the user. The option sets the _number_ of lines on a page
(default: 22).

While waiting for a newline, _p_ interprets the commands:

*!*::
  Pass the rest of the line to the shell as a command.
*q*::
  Quit.
