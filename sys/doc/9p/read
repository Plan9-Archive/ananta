= read, write: transfer data from and to a file

    size[4] Tread tag[2] fid[4] offset[8] count[4]
    size[4] Rread tag[2] count[4] data[count]

    size[4] Twrite tag[2] fid[4] offset[8] count[4] data[count]
    size[4] Rwrite tag[2] count[4]

The  read  request asks for count bytes of data from the file
identified by fid, which must be opened for reading, starting
offset  bytes after the beginning of the file.  The bytes are
returned with the read reply message.

The count field in the reply indicates the  number  of  bytes
returned.   This  may  be less than the requested amount.  If
the offset field is greater than or equal to  the  number  of
bytes in the file, a count of zero will be returned.

For directories, read returns an integral number of directory
entries exactly as in stat (see stat(5)), one for each member
of  the directory.  The read request message must have offset
equal to zero or the value of offset in the previous read  on
the  directory, plus the number of bytes returned in the pre‐
vious read.  In other words, seeking other than to the begin‐
ning is illegal in a directory (see sys-seek(2)).

The  write  request asks that count bytes of data be recorded
in the file identified by fid, which must be opened for writ‐
ing,  starting  offset bytes after the beginning of the file.
If the file is append-only, the data will be  placed  at  the
end of the file regardless of offset.  Directories may not be
written.

The write reply records the number of bytes actually written.
It is usually an error if this is not the same as requested.

Because  9P  implementations may limit the size of individual
messages, more than one message may be produced by  a  single
read or write call.  The iounit field returned by open(5), if
non-zero, reports the maximum size that is guaranteed  to  be
transferred atomically.


== entry points

Read  and  write  messages are generated by the corresponding
calls in sys-read(2).  Although sys-seek(2) affects the  off‐
set, it does not generate a message.
