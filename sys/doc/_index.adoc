_inf_ is designed for simplicity;
to do so, the system makes a few (as of yet) uncommon choices to provide a beautiful and clean machine.

== unix differences

The system notes several differences from many standard unix-based facilities;
some of the major ones follow.

 - return signals are strings: an empty string indicates success and a non-empty one contains a failure message
 - utilities are more strictly single purpose (e.g., without a thousand options, arguments, or flags)
 - strings are not NUL terminated (in fact, the NUL character is invalid in a string)
 - no superuser account

== windows differences
