INDIR(3)              Library Functions Manual              INDIR(3)

NAME
       indir - attach to device indirectly by name

SYNOPSIS
       bind  #*name [!spec]  dir

DESCRIPTION
       Indir  allows  any other device to be referred to by its name
       instead of its perhaps arbitrary single character type; indir
       itself  has  the type character `*'.  It has no name space of
       its own.  On attach  (see  attach(5))  indir  interprets  its
       device  specifier  string as the name of a device to which it
       should attach, optionally followed by specifier spec for that
       device,  separated  from  the  name  by  an exclamation mark.
       Attaching to indir (eg, by sys-bind(2)), effectively attaches
       to  the  device  with the given name and spec, and all subse‐
       quent operations in the  resulting  name  space  access  that
       device, not indir itself.

       For example, to access cap(3), one could write:

              bind -a '#*cap' /dev

       The  following  commands  both  list  the  second instance of
       ether(3), first directly, then using indir:

              ls '#l1'
              ls '#*ether!1'

       The file /dev/drivers (see cons(3)) lists the names  of  cur‐
       rently configured devices.

   Credit
       Invented  by  Bruce  Ellis  for  Lucent's  internal  Research
       Inferno to help name dynamically-loaded device drivers.  This
       is a re-implementation.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If  name is not configured, indir returns a suitable diagnos‐
       tic in the error string.

BUGS
       Arguably the kernel could simply look up the name itself.
