SRV(3)                Library Functions Manual                SRV(3)

NAME
       srv - server registry

SYNOPSIS
       bind #s [ spec ] /chan

       sys->bind("#sspec", "/chan", Sys->MREPL);

DESCRIPTION
       Srv  converts  between file system operations by applications
       and messages on channels, as described  in  sys-file2chan(2).
       Each  attach  that  does  not  include  a spec produces a new
       instance: an empty directory owned by  the  current  user  in
       which  only  files  may  be  created,  and  then only by sys-
       file2chan, using a special  internal  interface.   Each  such
       file  initially has the same owner as the directory, and per‐
       missions 8r600 (read-write for the owner only), but the  per‐
       missions  can  be changed by Sys->wstat (see sys-stat(2)) and
       thus chmod(1).  If mode Sys->DMEXCL is thereby set, the  file
       becomes  exclusive-use  and can be opened by only one process
       at a time.  The file length and mode  bit  Sys->DMAPPEND  may
       also be set by wstat but are not interpreted by the system.

       Files  may be removed, directly using sys-remove(2) (and thus
       rm(1)), or indirectly by opening them with mode  Sys->ORCLOSE
       (see  sys-open(2)).  File2chan also removes the corresponding
       file when the last references to the server's read and  write
       channels have gone (eg, on server exit).

       A  spec  may  be  given to name specific instances of srv, so
       that a new name space  can  bind  in  a  service  created  in
       another.   Only  the owner (original creator) of the instance
       may attach to it, unless the mode of the service directory is
       changed  using  Sys->wstat  (see sys-stat(2)) to have general
       access.

FILES
       /chan  directory to which srv is conventionally bound by var‐
              ious applications
