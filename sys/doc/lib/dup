= dup: dups of open files

    bind #d /fd

    /fd/0
    /fd/0ctl
    /fd/1
    /fd/1ctl
    ...

The  dup device serves a one-level directory containing files
whose names are decimal numbers.  Each such file also has  an
associated  control  file.   A  file of name n corresponds to
open file descriptor n in the current process.

A sys-open(2) of file n results in a file descriptor  identi‐
cal  to what would be returned from a system call sys->dup(n,
-1).  Note that the result is no longer a  file  in  the  dup
device.

The stat operation returns information about the device file,
not the open file it points to.  A stat of #d/n will  contain
n  for  the  name,  0  for  the  length, and 400, 200, or 600
(octal) for the mode, depending on whether the dup target  is
open for reading, writing, or both.

A file of name nctl may be read to discover the properties of
the associated file descriptor, in format identical  to  that
of the fd file in prog(3).
