Fpga allows configuration of an on-board FPGA (eg, the Altera
Flex6000 on the Bright Star Engineering  ip-Engine),  control
of  its clocks and environment, and raw access to any devices
presented in the FPGA address space.  On  booting,  the  FPGA
subsystem  is  normally  left  powered  down and the system's
external clocks are not directed to  the  processor's  output
pins, to conserve power if the subsystem is unused.

The control file fpgactl accepts the following requests:

bclk n Set BCLK output to n MHz, where n must be a divisor of
       the system clock frequency (eg, of 48 if the system is
       running at 48 MHz).

power  Power  up  the  FPGA  subsystem (that is automatically
       done when fpgaprog is accessed).

power off
       Power down the FPGA subsystem.

reset  Reset the FPGA, forcing  it  into  configuration  mode
       (automatically done when fpgaprog is accessed).

vclk n m v r
       Program  the  clock synthesiser with the given parame‐
       ters, and enable its output as VCLK.

vclk off
       Disable output from the clock synthesiser.

The files fpgamemb and fpgamemw give 8-bit and 16-bit  access
respectively  to  the  address space interpreted by the FPGA.
The file offset is the address read or  written  within  that
space;  offset and count must both be even for fpgamemw.  The
interpretation of the data, including  the  data  format  and
whether byte or word access is required, is completely deter‐
mined by the program configured into the FPGA.

The write-only file fpgaprog configures the device.  A single
write  provides  an  FPGA configuration in raw binary format.
The FPGA subsystem is given power, the processor's clocks are
made  visible  externally,  and the device is configured with
the data written.  The write returns an error  if  configura‐
tion fails.

The  read-only file fpgastatus contains a single line of text
giving the state of the two status bits in  the  FPGA  inter‐
face.   The  word  config  appears if CONFIG_DONE is set, and
!config otherwise; the word status appears if nSTATUS is set,
and !status otherwise.
