= gpio: access to GPIO registers

The  GPIO  interface  serves  a one-level directory with five
files that give access to the GPIO registers in  the  SA1100.
See  the  SA1100  handbook for details of the function of the
various registers.

The control file gpioctl accepts commands to  set  individual
bits  in the edge detect registers.  Each control message has
three space-separated fields:

       reg pin value

where reg is a single character denoting a  register,  pin  a
bit  within  it,  and  val  the  value (0 or 1) for that bit.
Valid choices for reg are: d (GPDR), r (GRER), f (GFER),  and
a (GAFR).  For example, the control message

       d 10 1

sets  bit  10 (following the handbook's bit-numbering conven‐
tions) in the GPIO pin direction register GPDR.

The read-only file gpiostatus shows the names and values  (in
hexadecimal) of all GPIO registers.

The  remaining  data files allow bits to be read by Sys->read
requests and set by Sys->write  requests.   When  read,  each
file  returns  the  value  of  a given register as a single 8
digit hexadecimal number: gpioset and gpioclear both give the
value  of  the  level  register, GPLR; and gpioedge gives the
value of the edge dectect register, GEDR.  Each write request
should  present  a  single  number  in textual form, which is
assumed to be hexadecimal by default.  The value  is  written
to  a  GPIO  register: gpioset corresponds to GPSR, gpioclear
corresponds to GPCR, and gpioedge corresponds to GEDR.
