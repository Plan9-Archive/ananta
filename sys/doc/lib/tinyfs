TINYFS(3)             Library Functions Manual             TINYFS(3)

NAME
       tinyfs - file system for miniscule devices

SYNOPSIS
       bind -c #Fname /nvfs

DESCRIPTION
       Tinyfs  provides  file  system access to the contents of low-
       capacity devices, ranging  from  several  hundred  bytes  (at
       least  144  bytes) to at most the order of a kilobyte.  It is
       provided to support file system access to small  non-volatile
       memories,  as  for instance are found in some real-time clock
       chips, where IDs, keys, PINs, certificates and the like might
       be stored by either client or server.

       The  file  system has only one directory, its root, which can
       contain only files.  Once created, a write can only append to
       a  file;  random  updates  are not allowed, although the file
       could be truncated and rewritten.

       The device specifier following the #F device name is the name
       of  a  file  in /dev on which the tiny file system will live.
       For instance, #Fnvram refers to /dev/nvram.  The device  must
       allow  seek  and  write.  During the attach, the system scans
       the device, checking the file system structure by building  a
       table of files, and checking a checksum stored in each block;
       inconsistent structure is reinitialised, and  thus  a  previ‚Äê
       ously  unused  device  will  emerge correctly formatted as an
       empty tiny file system.
