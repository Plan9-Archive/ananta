= ds: compound device subsystems

    bind -b #k /dev

    /dev/ds
    /dev/ds/ctl
    /dev/ds/...

Ds  builds  complex  block  storage subsystems out of simpler
ones.  Inspired by the Plan 9 file server kernel's configura‐
tion  strings,  it  provides  device mirroring, partitioning,
interleaving, and catenation for block-oriented file systems.

It serves a two-level directory.  The top  level  contains  a
single  directory  ds,  which contains a control file ctl and
one file per configured device.

The control messages each introduce a new device, here  named
new.  The file arguments are interpreted in the name space of
the writer.

mirror new files...
       The device new corresponds to a RAID  1  mirroring  of
       files.   Writes  to  new  are  handled by sequentially
       writing to the files from right to left  (the  reverse
       of of the order in the control message).  If any write
       fails, the write is aborted.  Reads from new are  han‐
       dled  by sequentially reading from the files from left
       to right until one succeeds.  The length of the mirror
       device is the minimum of the lengths of the files.

part new file offset length
       The  device new corresponds to the length bytes start‐
       ing at offset in file.  If offset+length reaches  past
       the end of file, length is silently reduced to fit.

inter new files...
       The  device  new corresponds to the block interleaving
       of files; an 8192-byte block size is assumed.

cat name files...
       The device new corresponds to the catenation of files.

If the variable fsconfig is set in plan9.ini(8) then ds  will
read  its  configuration from the file $fsconfig on the first
attach.  This is useful when the machine boots from  a  local
file server that uses fs.

== example
Mirror  the  two  disks  /dev/sdC0/data and /dev/sdD0/data as
/dev/ds/m0;    similarly,    mirror    /dev/sdC1/data     and
/dev/sdD1/data as /dev/ds/m1:

       echo mirror m0 /dev/sdC0/data /dev/sdD0/data >/dev/ds/ctl
       echo mirror m1 /dev/sdC1/data /dev/sdD1/data >/dev/ds/ctl

Interleave the two mirrored disks to create /dev/ds/data:

       echo inter data /dev/ds/m0 /dev/ds/m1 >/dev/ds/ctl

Run kfs(4) on the interleaved device:

       disk/kfs -f /dev/ds/data

Save the configuration:

       cp /dev/ds/ctl /dev/fd0disk
       To  load the configuration automatically at boot time,
       add this to plan9.ini:

       fsconfig=/dev/fd0disk

== bugs
Should be able to select block size for interleaved devices.
