NAME
       i82365  - Personal Computer Memory Card Interface Association
       (PCMCIA) device

SYNOPSIS
       bind -a #y /dev

       /dev/pcm0attr
       /dev/pcm0ctl
       /dev/pcm0mem
       /dev/pcm1attr
       /dev/pcm1ctl
       /dev/pcm1mem

DESCRIPTION
       The  i82365  driver  provides  an  interface  to   an   Intel
       82365-compatible  PCMCIA  interface chip.  This chip supports
       up to 2 PCMCIA slots, 0 and 1.  Reading  pcm[01]attr  returns
       the   contents  of  attribute  memory.   Reading  or  writing
       pcm[01]mem  reads  or  writes  RAM  on  the  card.    Reading
       pcm[01]ctl returns the card's status.

       This  driver  must  be included to use PCMCIA devices such as
       the NE4100 Ethernet card.  The individual card  drivers  make
       calls to routines in the PCMCIA driver.
