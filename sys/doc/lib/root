This device is set up by the kernel to be the initial root of
the name space.  In the emulation environment, the  names  in
the one-level tree shown above are mostly just place-holders,
to allow a place on which to bind (see sys-bind(2)).

In the native environment,  an  arbitrary  initial  directory
structure and file content can be built-in when the kernel is
configured, but it will typically include at least the  names
above,  to  act  as mount points.  (See the discussion of the
`root section' in conf(10.6).)  The required file /osinit.dis
(not  present  in the emulation environment) provides an exe‚Äê
cutable Dis binary  when  read,  and  is  the  first  program
invoked when initialising the system.  Other files needed for
bootstrap might also reside in this device.

Its local name #/ can be used by programs outside the kernel,
for instance to implement newns in newns(2).
