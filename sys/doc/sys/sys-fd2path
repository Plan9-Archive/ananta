= fd2path: return file name associated with file descriptor

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    fd2path(fd: ref FD): string;

As  described  in  intro(2),  the kernel stores a rooted path
name with every open file or directory; typically, it is  the
name  used  in  the  original  access  of  the file.  Fd2path
returns the path name associated with  open  file  descriptor
fd.  (It returns nil if an error occurs.)

Changes  to  the underlying name space do not update the path
name stored with the file descriptor.   Therefore,  the  path
returned  by fd2path may no longer refer to the same file (or
indeed any file) after some component directory  or  file  in
the path has been removed, renamed or rebound.

As  an  example,  workdir(2) is implemented by opening .  and
executing fd2path on the resulting file descriptor.

== diagnostics
Fd2path  returns  nil  on  error  and  sets  the system error
string.
