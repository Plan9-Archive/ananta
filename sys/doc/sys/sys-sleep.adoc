= sleep: delay

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    sleep:    fn(period: int): int;

Sleep  suspends  the  current thread for period milliseconds.
The actual suspension time may be a little more or less  than
the requested time.  If period is 0, the process gives up the
CPU if another process is waiting to run,  returning  immedi‚Äê
ately if not.

Sleep  normally returns 0. In hosted Inferno it may return -1
to indicate that it was not possible to sleep (eg if no  more
threads are available).
