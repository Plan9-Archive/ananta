NAME
       selectfile - file browser

SYNOPSIS
       include "selectfile.m";
       selectfile := load Selectfile Selectfile->PATH;

       init:        fn();
       filename: fn(ctxt: ref Draw->Context, parent: ref Draw->Image,
                      title: string,

DESCRIPTION
       Selectfile  provides an interactive file browser for use by a
       wm(1) application.  It allows a user to browse the file  sys‐
       tem to select a file of a give type.

       Init  should be called once to initialise the module's inter‐
       nal state.

       Filename makes a dialog panel for selecting a  file.   It  is
       created in the graphics context ctxt, near the northeast cor‐
       ner of a given parent window,  parent,  represented  by  that
       window's  Image.   (If  the parent window is a Tk Toplevel t,
       for instance, the appropriate value is t.image.)   If  parent
       is  nil,  the  panel is centred on the screen.  Dir gives the
       directory where the file search  should  begin.   Only  files
       that  match  pat  are  displayed.  The returned string is the
       name of the selected file, or the empty string if no file was
       selected.
