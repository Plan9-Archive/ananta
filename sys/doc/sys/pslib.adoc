= pslib: postscript generation

    include "pslib.m";
    pslib := load Pslib Pslib->PATH;

    init: fn(bufio: Bufio);
    writeimage: fn(f: ref Bufio->Iobuf,
                   img: ref Draw->Image, dpi: int): string;

Pslib must first be initialised by calling Init with a loaded
Bufio module.  Writeimage writes a Postscript file containing
the data within img to f, which should first have been opened
for writing by bufio.  Dpi is a value  specifying  the  pixel
width of pixels in img; the width (and height) of dpi dots in
img will be one inch when the Postscript is rendered.

The resulting Postscript is really only suitable for  use  as
encapsulated  Postscript, as there's no way to set the desti‚Äê
nation paper size.

There should be many more useful functions in this module.
