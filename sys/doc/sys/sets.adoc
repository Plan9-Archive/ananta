The  Sets  module  provides routines for manipulating sets of
small non-negative integers. There are currently  two  imple‐
mentations available: the implementation declared in sets32.m
stores sets of numbers from 0 to 31 inclusive; the  implemen‐
tation  in sets.m stores arbitrary sets of non-negative inte‐
gers.  The description given is for the more  general  imple‐
mentation;  behaviour of the other is undefined if an integer
higher than 31 is used.

Init must be called first, to allow Sets  to  initialise  its
internal  state.   Set returns a new set, containing nothing.
Str2set converts a string to a new  set;  the  string  should
have  been  created  with  Set.str().   Bytes2set converts an
array of bytes, d, as returned by Set.bytes(), to a new set.

Note that all set operations are copy operations; none change
an existing set.

s1.X(op, s2)
          Returns  a  new set, the result of combining s1 and
          s2 according to boolean operator op.  Op can be any
          bitwise  boolean combination of the two constants A
          and B, defined in the module. Notionally, each  set
          is an infinitely long string of bits, each bit rep‐
          resenting a non-negative integer: zero if the inte‐
          ger is present, and one if absent.  For each corre‐
          sponding bit in s1 and s2, X sets  a  corresponding
          bit  in  the returned set according to the calcula‐
          tion s1 op s2.

s.add(n)  Returns the set s with n added.

s.addlist(ns)
          Addlist is the same as calling add on  each  member
          of the list ns, but somewhat more efficient.

s.del(n)  Returns s with n removed.

s.invert()
          Invert returns a set holding all non-negative inte‐
          gers  other  than  those  already  in   s.    Hence
          set().invert() holds all non-negative integers.

s1.eq(s2) Returns non-zero if s1 is identical to s2.

s.holds(n)
          Returns non-zero if s holds n as a member.

s.isempty()
          Returns non-zero if s holds no members.

s.msb()   Returns  the "most significant bit": the membership
          status of all members that have not been explicitly
          set.     For    example,    set().msb()    is    0;
          set().invert().msb() is 1.

s.limit() If s.msb() is zero, s.limit() returns one more than
          the  largest  member  contained  in s, otherwise it
          returns one more than the largest member  not  con‐
          tained  in  s.   Thus  set().limit()  yields 0, and
          set().invert().del(5).limit() yields 6.

s.str()   Returns a string corresponding to s.  The format is
          hexdigits:msb,  where hexdigits give the least sig‐
          nificant members of the set,  most  significant  on
          the left, in hexadecimal format; msb gives the pad‐
          ding bit that fills the rest of the set.  Note that
          this format is compatible between the two implemen‐
          tations.

s.bytes(n)
          Returns a packed byte representaton  of  s  .   The
          array is held in little-endian order, with the top‐
          most bit of the top byte holding  the  msb  of  the
          set.   The  array  returned will contain at least n
          bytes.

== examples
Given two sets, s1 and s2, s1.X(A&B, s2) gives  their  inter‐
section;  s1.X(A|B, s2) their union; s1.X(A&~B, s2) gives the
set of all members of s1 that aren't in s2; s1.X(~(A|B),  s2)
gives the set of all integers in neither s1 nor s2.

     sys->print("%s\n", set().addlist(1::2::5::nil)
          .invert().X(A|B, set().add(2)).str());
produces the string ``dd:1'', corresponding to the set of all
non-negative integers except 1 and 5.
