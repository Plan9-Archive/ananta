= werrstr: set the system error string

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    werrstr(s: string): int;

When  a  system  call fails, it returns an error value (often
-1) and records a string  describing  the  error  in  a  per-
process  location.   The  verb  r in sys-print(2) outputs the
error string.  Werrstr sets the process's error string to  s,
to  allow a function in a module to mimic the error reporting
interface of a system call.
