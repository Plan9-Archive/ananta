PSLIB(2)                 System Calls Manual                PSLIB(2)

NAME
       pslib - postscript generation

SYNOPSIS
       include "pslib.m";
       pslib := load Pslib Pslib->PATH;

       init: fn(bufio: Bufio);
       writeimage: fn(f: ref Bufio->Iobuf,
                      img: ref Draw->Image, dpi: int): string;

DESCRIPTION
       Pslib must first be initialised by calling Init with a loaded
       Bufio module.  Writeimage writes a Postscript file containing
       the data within img to f, which should first have been opened
       for writing by bufio.  Dpi is a value  specifying  the  pixel
       width of pixels in img; the width (and height) of dpi dots in
       img will be one inch when the Postscript is rendered.

SEE ALSO
       bufio(2), draw-image(2)

BUGS
       The resulting Postscript is really only suitable for  use  as
       encapsulated  Postscript, as there's no way to set the desti‚Äê
       nation paper size.

       There should be many more useful functions in this module.
