= tftp: Trivial File Transfer Protocol

    tftp := load Tftp Tftp->PATH;
    Tftp: module
    {
       init:    fn(progress: int);
       receive: fn(host: string, filename: string,
                   fd: ref Sys->FD): string;
    };

Tftp fetches files from an Internet TFTP server.  It is typi‐
cally used only to fetch kernels or configuration files  when
booting.  Only one transfer can be active at any given time.

Init  must  be called once before using any other function of
the module.  If progress is non-zero, receive  will  periodi‐
cally  print  a  character  as  blocks are received: `.'  for
every 25 blocks, `S' for a sequence error, `T' for a timeout.

Receive attempts to fetch the contents of filename from  host
and writes the blocks of data to fd as they are received.  It
returns when the file transfer has completed, returning a nil
string  on  success  or  a diagnostic string otherwise.  When
booting, fd is typically open on the kexec file of boot(3).
