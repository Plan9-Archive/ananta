= export: export a name space

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    export:   fn(fd: ref FD, dir: string, flag: int):   int;

Export receives and replies to 9P requests from a client on a
connection represented by fd, for file operations on the part
of  the  current file name space rooted at dir, which is thus
exported.  This is the server end of the client's mount call.
Names  presented  by  the  client are interpreted relative to
directory dir, which can be adjusted  using  sys-pctl(2)  and
sys-bind(2)  before  export.   The file descriptor fd must be
open for reading and writing, and neither  mounted  elsewhere
nor already exported.

Commonly,  export's  first argument is a file descriptor open
on the data file in the dir of a Connection returned by  lis‐
ten  (see dial(2)).  Before calling export, the connection on
fd can optionally be authenticated and set for encryption  or
digesting using the functions in security-auth(2).

The export function takes two mutually exclusive flags:

Sys->EXPWAIT
       Export blocks until all client requests are complete.

Sys->EXPASYNC
       Client  requests  are handled by a background (kernel)
       process.  Export  returns  immediately.   The  serving
       process terminates when the client hangs up.

== examples
Export a given directory on fd, protecting it from subsequent
changes:

       exportdir(fd: ref Sys->FD, dir: string, pid: chan of int)
       {
            pid <-= sys->pctl(Sys->FORKNS|Sys->FORKENV|Sys->NEWFD, fd.fd :: nil);
            sys->export(fd, dir, Sys->EXPWAIT);
       }

The FORKNS given to pctl forks the name space,  and  prevents
the  sys->export from seeing the effects of subsequent mounts
by the process that calls or spawns exportdir.  The exportdir
function above might be called using:

       pid := chan of int;
       spawn exportdir(fd, "/", pid);
       expid := <-pid;

Service  will  stop  automatically  when  the  connection  fd
returns end-of-file (eg, when it hangs up), but it  can  also
be stopped locally by killing expid.

== diagnostics
Export  returns  a  non-negative  value  on success and -1 on
error; the system error string is set.
