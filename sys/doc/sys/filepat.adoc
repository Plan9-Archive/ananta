= filepat: expand, match: file pattern matching

    include "filepat.m";
    filepat := load Filepat Filepat->PATH;

    expand:  fn(pat: string): list of string;
    match:   fn(pat, name: string): int;

Expand builds a list of file names in alphabetical order that
match the pattern pat.  The pattern is tokenised using / as a
delimiter.

Match returns 1 if name matches the pattern pat, and 0 other‐
wise.

The pat passed to match and expand may  include  combinations
of the special characters *, ?, [, and ].

The asterisk * matches a string of zero or more characters.

The query ?  matches any single character.

The  notation  [s], where s is a nonempty string, matches any
single character in s.  The  notation  [^s],  where  s  is  a
nonempty  string, matches any single character not in s.  The
characters *, ?, and [ have no special meaning within s.

If any character is preceded by the character \, that charac‐
ter loses any special meaning and is interpreted literally.
