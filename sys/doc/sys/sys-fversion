SYS-FVERSION(2)          System Calls Manual         SYS-FVERSION(2)

NAME
       fversion - initialize 9P connection and negotiate version

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       fversion: fn(fd: ref FD, bufsize: int, version: string): (int, string);

DESCRIPTION
       Fversion  initialises the 9P connection represented by fd and
       negotiates the maximum message size and the  version  of  the
       protocol to be used.

       The  bufsize  determines  the  size of the I/O buffer used to
       stage 9P requests to the server, subject to  the  constraints
       of the server itself.  The version is a text string that rep‐
       resents the highest version level the protocol will support.

       Fversion returns a tuple (n,useversion) where n is -1 if  the
       request  was rejected, and otherwise n is bufsize and usever‐
       sion is a string representing the negotiated, possibly lower,
       version of the protocol.

       Default  values  of zero for bufsize and the empty string for
       version will negotiate sensible defaults for the connection.

       The interpretation of the version strings is defined in  ver‐
       sion(5).

       It  is  rare  to  use  fversion directly; usually the default
       negotiation performed by the kernel during  mount  (see  sys-
       bind(2)) is sufficient.

SEE ALSO
       sys-fauth(2), intro(5), version(5).

DIAGNOSTICS
       Fversion  returns  a  value  of  -1 for n on error, including
       failure to negotiate acceptable values, and sets  the  system
       error string.

BUGS
       The  returned  value  of n when no error occurs should be the
       negotiated message size but is currently the original bufsize
       parameter.
