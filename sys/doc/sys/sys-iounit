= iounit: return size of atomic I/O unit for file descriptor

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    iounit:   fn(fd: ref FD): int;

Reads and writes of files are transmitted using the 9P proto‐
col (see intro(5)) and in general, operations involving large
amounts  of  data  must  be broken into smaller pieces by the
operating system.  The `I/O unit' associated with  each  file
descriptor  records  the  maximum size, in bytes, that may be
read or written without breaking up the transfer.

The iounit system call returns the I/O unit size for the open
file  fd.  Certain file descriptors, particularly those asso‐
ciated with devices, may have no specific I/O unit, in  which
case iounit will return zero.

Returns  zero  if any error occurs or if the I/O unit size of
the fd is unspecified or unknown.
