    millisec: fn(): int;

Millisec  returns  the  value of an internal system clock, in
milliseconds.  The actual resolution of the clock is a  prop‐
erty  of the underlying system and may be coarser than a mil‐
lisecond.  The epoch is arbitrary, so millisec is useful  for
measuring  durations  but  not  absolute time.  If the system
operates  continuously,  the  millisecond  counter  overflows
every few months; a reboot resets the epoch.
