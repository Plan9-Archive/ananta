SYS-FAUTH(2)             System Calls Manual            SYS-FAUTH(2)

NAME
       fauth  - set up authentication on a file descriptor to a file
       server

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       fauth:  fn(fd: ref FD, aname: string): ref FD;

DESCRIPTION
       Fauth provides a means for the current user  to  authenticate
       to  access resources available through the 9P connection rep‐
       resented by fd.  The return value is a file descriptor,  con‐
       ventionally  called afd, that is subsequently used to execute
       the authentication protocol for the server.  After successful
       authentication, afd may be passed as the second argument to a
       subsequent mount call (see sys-bind(2)), with the same aname,
       as a ticket-of-entry for the user.

       If  fauth  returns  nil,  the error case, that means the file
       server does not require authentication  for  the  connection,
       and afd should be nil in the call to mount.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The system error string is set on error, including the server
       not requiring authentication, and fauth returns nil.
