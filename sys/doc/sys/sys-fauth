= fauth : set up authentication on a file descriptor to a file server

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    fauth:  fn(fd: ref FD, aname: string): ref FD;

Fauth provides a means for the current user  to  authenticate
to  access resources available through the 9P connection rep‐
resented by fd.  The return value is a file descriptor,  con‐
ventionally  called afd, that is subsequently used to execute
the authentication protocol for the server.  After successful
authentication, afd may be passed as the second argument to a
subsequent mount call (see sys-bind(2)), with the same aname,
as a ticket-of-entry for the user.

If  fauth  returns  nil,  the error case, that means the file
server does not require authentication  for  the  connection,
and afd should be nil in the call to mount.

The system error string is set on error, including the server
not requiring authentication, and fauth returns nil.
