= virgil: pose question to name resolver

    include "security.m";
    virgil := load Virgil Virgil->PATH;

    virgil:   fn(args: list of string): string;
    
Virgil provides a client side interface for interactions with
the name resolution service virgild(8).

Args is a command line of the form:

       virgil [-v address] [name]

Name is the host name to be resolved to  a  network  address.
Normally  the  request  is  broadcast  to any and all virgild
servers on the network,  which  virgil  expects  to  find  on
UDP/IP  port 2202.  The -v option instead directs the request
to the given numeric IP address.

Virgil waits up to 5 seconds for a reply, retransmitting  the
request  once  a  second.   It  accepts and returns the first
answer it receives.
