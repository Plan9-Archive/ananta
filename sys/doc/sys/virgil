VIRGIL(2)                System Calls Manual               VIRGIL(2)

NAME
       virgil - pose question to name resolver

SYNOPSIS
       include "security.m";
       virgil := load Virgil Virgil->PATH;

       virgil:   fn(args: list of string): string;

DESCRIPTION
       Virgil provides a client side interface for interactions with
       the name resolution service virgild(8).

       Args is a command line of the form:

              virgil [-v address] [name]

       Name is the host name to be resolved to  a  network  address.
       Normally  the  request  is  broadcast  to any and all virgild
       servers on the network,  which  virgil  expects  to  find  on
       UDP/IP  port 2202.  The -v option instead directs the request
       to the given numeric IP address.

       Virgil waits up to 5 seconds for a reply, retransmitting  the
       request  once  a  second.   It  accepts and returns the first
       answer it receives.

DIAGNOSTICS

       resolved.

BUGS
       The virgild port is hard coded.
