RAND(2)                  System Calls Manual                 RAND(2)

NAME
       rand - pseudo random number generation

SYNOPSIS
       include "rand.m";
       rand = load Rand Rand->PATH;

       init:    fn(seed: int);
       rand:    fn(modulus: int): int;
       bigrand: fn(modulus: big): big;

DESCRIPTION
       Init  initialises  the  pseudo-random  number  generator with
       seed; subsequent calls to rand and bigrand return  a  pseudo-
       random  sequence  of integers or bigs respectively, between 0
       and modulus-1.  Modulus should be a non-negative integer; for
       bigrand, it should be less than 2^53.
