= rand: pseudo random number generation

    include "rand.m";
    rand = load Rand Rand->PATH;

    init:    fn(seed: int);
    rand:    fn(modulus: int): int;
    bigrand: fn(modulus: big): big;

Init  initialises  the  pseudo-random  number  generator with
seed; subsequent calls to rand and bigrand return  a  pseudo-
random  sequence  of integers or bigs respectively, between 0
and modulus-1.  Modulus should be a non-negative integer; for
bigrand, it should be less than 2^53.
