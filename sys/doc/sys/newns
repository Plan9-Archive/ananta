= newns: newns, newuser: build a new name space from a description file

    include "newns.m";
    ns := load Newns Newns->PATH;

    newns:   fn(user: string, nsfile: string): string;
    newuser: fn(user: string, cap: string, nsfile: string): string;

Newns reads file nsfile and builds a new name space based  on
the commands it contains.  The file has the format defined by
namespace(6).  If nsfile is nil or empty, then newns attempts
to read file the file namespace.

Newuser  uses  a capability cap suitable for cap(3) to change
the current process's user name to user, and uses  newns  and
nsfile to build it a new name space.  The capability is typi‐
cally obtained via factotum(4).
