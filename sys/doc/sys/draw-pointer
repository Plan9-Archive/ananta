= Pointer: state of a pointer device such as a mouse

    include   "draw.m";
    draw := load Draw Draw->PATH;

    Pointer: adt
    {
        buttons:  int;
        xy:       Point;
    };

buttons   Each  button  on the device corresponds to a bit in
          buttons; zero bits indicate released (or  non-exis‐
          tent),  and  one  bits indicate pressed.  The bits,
          from least to most significant positions, represent
          the buttons from left to right.

xy        The pointer's screen coordinates.

Mux(1)  uses the cptr member of the Draw->Context adt to pass
pointer events through to applications.
