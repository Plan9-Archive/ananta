= chdir: change working directory

    include "sys.m";
    sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

    chdir:  fn(path: string): int;

Chdir  changes  the working directory of the invoking process
and its file name space group to path.

The working directory is the starting  point  for  evaluating
file  names  that  do  not begin with / or #, as explained in
sys-intro(2).

When Inferno boots, the initial process has / for its working
directory.

Applications that invoke chdir normally use the FORKNS option
of sys-pctl(2) to prevent the change from affecting the  sur‚Äê
rounding environment.
