SYS-CHDIR(2)             System Calls Manual            SYS-CHDIR(2)

NAME
       chdir - change working directory

SYNOPSIS
       include "sys.m";
       sys := load Sys Sys->PATH;

       chdir:  fn(path: string): int;

DESCRIPTION
       Chdir  changes  the working directory of the invoking process
       and its file name space group to path.

       The working directory is the starting  point  for  evaluating
       file  names  that  do  not begin with / or #, as explained in
       sys-intro(2).

       When Inferno boots, the initial process has / for its working
       directory.

       Applications that invoke chdir normally use the FORKNS option
       of sys-pctl(2) to prevent the change from affecting the  sur‚Äê
       rounding environment.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Returns 0 on success; -1 on failure.
