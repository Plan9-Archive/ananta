= kprof: kernel profiling

    bind -a #T /dev

    /dev/kpctl
    /dev/kpdata

The kprof device provides simple profiling data for the oper‐
ating system kernel.   The data accumulates by recording  the
program  counter  of the kernel at each `tick' of a profiling
clock. Often this is just the system clock,  but  may  be  an
independent  higher  priority timer which allows profiling of
interrupt handlers, dependent on implementation.

The file kpdata holds the accumulated  counts  in  big-endian
byte order.  The size of the file depends on the size of ker‐
nel text, and the size of the individual counts.   The  first
six  counts  are  4 bytes in size, and are special. The first
holds the total number of ticks, the  second  the  number  of
ticks  which fell outside the kernel text, the third the num‐
ber of microseconds per tick, the fourth the number of sample
buckets,  the  fifth the size in bytes of each sample bucket,
and sixth the log base 2 of the sample bucket size. Typically
the sample size is 4, and the log base 2 of the bucket size 3
(8 bytes). The remainder of the file holds the  sample  buck‐
ets. The entire file has size sample bucket size times number
of sample buckets.  That is, the first six sample buckets are
replaced with the special numbers.

The  file kpctl controls profiling.  Writing the string start
to kpctl begins profiling; stop terminates it.   The  message
startclr  restarts  profiling  after  zeroing  the  array  of
counts.

Kprof(10.1) formats the data for presentation.

== example
The following sh(1) commands define  and  invoke  a  function
sample  that  runs a given test program with kernel profiling
enabled, and copies the result to a  server  presumed  to  be
mounted on /n/remote.

fn sample {
     echo start >/dev/kpctl
     $1
     echo stop >/dev/kpctl
     cp /dev/kpdata /n/remote/tmp/kpdata
}
bind -a '#T' /dev
sample {cp sound /dev/audio}

On the server, the kprof(10.1) command is used to analyse the
data:
     kprof /usr/inferno/os/mpc/impc /tmp/kpdata

== source
/os/port/devkprof.c

kprof(10.1)

== bugs
It cannot provide times for each node  in  the  dynamic  call
graph (dynamic profiling).
