The  audio device serves a one-level directory containing two
files, giving access to the host or native audio device in  a
platform-independent way.

Audio  is  the  data  file,  which  can be read or written to
exchange data with the device. Audio data is  a  sequence  of
stereo  samples, left sample first, each of which is a 16 bit
little-endian two's complement integer.

Audioctl is the associated control file, which sets the char‐
acteristics of the device.  Reads return lines of the form

source [in out] value

source in value out value

source [in out] left value right value

source in left value right value out left value right value
       The  qualifiers in, out and left, right are omitted if
       they are not applicable or if the input/output  and/or
       left/right  values are the same.  The source is one of
       audio, aux1, aux2, line, mono,  mic,  rate,  chans  or
       bits.   If  source  is  one  of the ports audio, aux1,
       aux2, line, mono or mic, value represents  the  volume
       on  a  scale  of  0 (quiet) to 100 (loud). The default
       volume is 50 for the audio port and 0 for the  remain‐
       der.  If the source is rate, value represents the rate
       at which the data was recorded in Hz. The  default  is
       22050.  If the source is chans, value is the number of
= channels of audio data: 2 (the default)  for  stereo,
       otherwise mono. If the source is bits, value is one of
       4, 8 or 16, the sample size in bits.

[in out] enc format
       Outputs the recording format on the input and/or  out‐
       put channels.  Format is one of ulaw, alaw, pcm, pcm16
       or adpcm

loop value
       Value is 0 or 1 to disable or enable loopback  respec‐
       tively.

Writes control the device with strings of a similar format as
that for reads.

source [in out] value

source in value out value

source [in out] left value right value

source in left value right value out left value right value
       Set the corresponding value/volume for the  particular
       source.   The  same  conventions  apply as in the read
       case above. The default value of source is audio.

reset  Set all attributes to their default value.

loop value
       Enable (1) or disable (0) loopback mode.

[in out] enc format
       Set the recording format on the  input  and/or  output
       channels to format.  Format is one of ulaw, alaw, pcm,
       adpcm.

[left right] dev input
       Set the input source of the left  and/or  right  ADCs.
       Input is one of mic, line, aux1, loop.

== bugs
The  device  has  not been implemented on every platform that
could provide it, particularly hosted implementations.
/os/port/devaudio.c (a driver for  the  SB16)  implements  an
older interface of broadly similar form, but using volume not
audioctl, and supports a subset  of  the  commands  described
above.
The  device is exclusive-use and cannot mix streams from sev‐
eral clients.
