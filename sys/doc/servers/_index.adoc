= servers: introduction to file servers

This section describes programs that serve Styx (see intro(5)), and can therefore be mounted, generating a new part of the name space.
Some, such as dossrv, thereby make the contents of a foreign file format visible directly to Inferno applications;
others, such as acme, provide their own services through operations on files in a name space.
