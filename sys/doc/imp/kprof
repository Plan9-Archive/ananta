KPROF(10.1)                                              KPROF(10.1)

NAME
       kprof - display kernel profiling data

SYNOPSIS
       kprof kernel kpdata

DESCRIPTION
       Kprof  presents  the data accumulated by the kernel profiling
       device, kprof(3).  The symbol table is taken  from  the  file
       kernel,  the  executable  file of the operating system kernel
       that was profiled.  The data file kpdata is usually a copy of
       /dev/kpdata from the device running the profiling kernel.

       The  symbol  table  is  read  and correlated with the profile
       data.  For each symbol, the time (in milliseconds) spent exe‚Äê
       cuting  between  that  symbol  and  the  next  is printed (in
       decreasing order), together with the percentage of the  total
       time.
