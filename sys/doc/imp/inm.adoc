= inm: Inferno name list (symbol table)

    inm [ -aghnsu ] file ...

Inm prints the name list of each executable or object file in
the  argument  list.   If  the  file  is  an   archive   (see
iar(10.1)),  the  name  list  of  each file in the archive is
printed.  If more than one file  is  given  in  the  argument
list,  the  name  of each file is printed at the beginning of
each line.

Each symbol name is preceded by its hexadecimal value (blanks
if undefined) and one of the letters

T      text segment symbol

t      static text segment symbol

L      leaf function text segment symbol

l      static leaf function text segment symbol

D      data segment symbol

d      static data segment symbol

B      bss segment symbol

b      static bss segment symbol

a      automatic (local) variable symbol

p      function parameter symbol

z      source file name

Z      source file line offset

f      source file name components

The output is sorted alphabetically.

Options are:

-a     Print  all  symbols;  normally only user-defined text,
       data, and bss segment symbols are printed.

-g     Print only global (T, L, D, B) symbols.

-h     Do not print file name headers with output lines.

-n     Sort according to the address of the symbols.

-s     Don't sort; print in symbol-table order.

-u     Print only undefined symbols.
