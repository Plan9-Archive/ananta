= kstrip: remove symbols from kernel images

    kstrip file ...

    kstrip -o ofile file

Kstrip  removes  symbol table segments from executable files,
rewriting the files in  place.   Stripping  a  file  requires
write permission on the file and the directory it is in.

If  the  -o  flag  is  given,  the  single input file file is
stripped and the result written to ofile.  File is unchanged.
