    2a [ option ...  ] [ name ...  ]
    etc.

These programs assemble the named files into object files for
the corresponding architectures; see 2c(10.1) for the  corre‐
spondence  between  an  architecture and the character (1, 2,
etc.) that specifies it.  The assemblers handle the most com‐
mon C preprocessor directives and the associated command-line
options -D and -I.  Other options are:

-o obj Place output in file obj (allowed  only  if  there  is
       just  one  input  file).   Default is to take the last
       element of the input path name, strip any trailing .s,
       and  append  .O, where O is first letter of the assem‐
       bler's name.

== files
The directory /sys/include  is  searched  for  include  files
after machine-dependent files in /$objtype/include.

== source
/utils/2a, etc.

== see ALSO
2c(10.1), 2l(10.1).
