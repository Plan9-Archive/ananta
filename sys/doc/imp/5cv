= 5cv, mkppcimage, sqz: convert kernel executable to boot format

    5cv [ -Dn ] [ -Hn ] [ -s ] executable outfile

    mkppcimage [ -l loadaddr ] executable outfile

    sqz [ -w ] [ -t ] executable

These commands convert a kernel executable in Inferno/Plan  9
a.out(10.5)  format  into  another  format  used  by  a third
party's boot loader.  Most convert the input  executable  and
write the new format to outfile.

5cv  converts  an ARM executable into one of several alterna‐
tive formats.  The output format  is  controlled  by  the  -H
option:

-H1     AIF for RISCOS.

-H2     Plan 9.

-H3     Boot for NetBSD.

-H4     Headerless,  stripped,  and  padded  to 2K in length.
        Used for the ROM resident serial bootstrap loader  in
        a Cirrus EP72xx.

-H5     Headerless, and stripped, for general use.

-H6     EPOC IMG format. Not a complete conversion, currently
        sufficient for use with  some  NT  based  downloaders
        which  autosense the file type by the "EP" signature,
        and then ignore the contents of the header.

The other options are:

-s     Strip symbol table.

-Dn    Enables debug output.

Mkppcimage converts a PowerPC or ARM  executable  to  a  boot
image  format used by PPCBOOT and UBOOT.  The output file has
a PPCBOOT image with one component labelled as an `OS kernel'
for  the appropriate architecture, containing the a.out(10.6)
header, text and initialised data, all uncompressed.  Symbols
are  not  included.   By  default the load address is deduced
from the executable's entry point; the -l option allows load‐
addr to be set explicitly, with the number in C syntax (deci‐
mal by default).  Other attributes are deduced from the  exe‐
cutable.

Sqz squeezes (compresses) the given ARM or PowerPC executable
using a method that achieves respectable compression for exe‐
cutables  but is much faster to decompress than (say) gzip's.
By default, both the program text and  initialised  data  are
compressed;  the  -t  option  causes sqz to compress only the
program text, leaving the data as-is.  By default, sqz prints
compression  statistics  on its standard error output; the -w
option causes it also to write the  compressed  file  on  its
standard  output.   Either  the  bootstrap that loads it must
decompress the result, or a small uncompressed stub must also
be loaded that decompresses the remainder.
