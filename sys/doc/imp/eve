EVE(10.2)                                                  EVE(10.2)

NAME
       eve, iseve - privileged user

SYNOPSIS
       char  eve[NAMELEN] = "inferno";

       int   iseve(void)

DESCRIPTION
       Eve  is  a  null-terminated string containing the name of the
       privileged user,  often  called  the  `host  owner',  in  the
       Inferno  system.   The  default identity in native systems is
       and in hosted Inferno it is the user who started emu(1).  The
       initial process created by system initialisation is given the
       eve identity.

       Iseve returns true if the current user is eve.  Several driv‐
       ers  use iseve to check the caller's identity before granting
       permission to perform certain actions.  For example, the con‐
       sole  driver allows only the user eve to write a new identity
       into the /dev/user file.  The privileges are  strictly  local
       and  do  not  extend into the network (in particular, to file
       servers).

       Note that the comparison performed by  iseve  is  case-sensi‐
       tive, even when running hosted on systems where usernames are
       case-insensitive.

                                                           EVE(10.2)
