READNUM(10.2)                                          READNUM(10.2)

NAME
       readnum, readstr - return values from read from device

SYNOPSIS
       int readstr(ulong off, char *buf, ulong n, char *str)

       int  readnum(ulong  off,  char  *buf, ulong n, ulong val, int
       size)

DESCRIPTION
       Readstr and readnum simplify the return of strings  and  num‐
       bers  from  device  read routines, because they deal with any
       buffering and boundary cases.  Several parameters to the read
       call  are  often  handed  on directly to these functions: the
       file offset, as off; the address of  the  user's  buffer,  as
       buf; and the number of bytes requested, as n.  Both functions
       return the number of bytes they have stored in buf, and which
       can often be returned directly from the device read routine.

       Readstr  satisfies  a  read by copying data into buf from the
       NUL-terminated  string  in  str.   The  data  transferred  is
       selected and limited by off, n and the length of str.

       Readnum converts the unsigned integer val to a decimal repre‐
       sentation in buf.  The value is right-justified in a field of
       size-1  places  and  is followed by a blank.  Size can be the
       global constant for 32-bit integers; the largest size allowed
       is 64 bytes.
