= error,  nexterror,  poperror, waserror: error handling functions

    void  error(char*)

    void  nexterror(void)

    void  poperror(void)

    int   waserror(void)

The kernel handles error conditions  using  non-local  gotos,
similar  to  setjmp/longjmp  in  ANSI C, but using a stack of
error labels to implement nested  exception  handling.   This
simplifies many of the internal interfaces by eliminating the
need for returning and checking error codes at every level of
the  call  stack, at the cost of requiring kernel routines to
adhere to a strict discipline.

Each kernel process (see kproc(10.2))  has  in  its  defining
Proc structure a stack of labels, currently 32 elements deep.
A kernel function that must perform a clean  up  or  recovery
action on an error makes a stylised call to waserror, nexter‐
ror and poperror:

       if(waserror()){
            /* recovery action */
            nexterror();
       }
       /* normal action */
       poperror();

When called in the normal course of events,  waserror  regis‐
ters  an  error  handling block by pushing its label onto the
stack, and returns zero.  The return value of waserror should
be  tested  as  shown above.  If non-zero (true), the calling
function should perform the needed error recovery, ended by a
call to nexterror to transfer control to the next location on
the error stack.  Typical recovery actions include deallocat‐
ing  memory,  unlocking  resources, and resetting state vari‐
ables.

Within the recovery block, after handling an error condition,
there  must  normally be a call to nexterror to transfer con‐
trol to any error recovery lower down in the stack.  The main
exception  is  in  the outermost function in a process, which
must not call nexterror (there being nothing further  on  the
stack),  but calls pexit (see kproc(10.2)) instead, to termi‐
nate the process.

When the need to recover a particular resource has passed,  a
function that has called waserror must remove the correspond‐
ing label from the stack by calling poperror.  This  must  be
done  before returning from the function; otherwise, a subse‐
quent call to error will return  to  an  obsolete  activation
record, with unpredictable but unpleasant consequences.

Error  copies  the  given  error message, which is limited to
ERRMAX bytes, into the Osenv.errstr of the  current  process,
enables  interrupts  by  calling  spllo  (native  only),  and
finally calls nexterror to start invoking the recovery proce‐
dures    currently    stacked   by   waserror.    The   files
/os/port/error.h and /emu/port/error.h offer a wide selection
of  predefined  error messages, suitable for almost any occa‐
sion.  The message set by the most recent call to  error  can
be obtained within the kernel by examining up->env->error and
in an application, by using the directive of sys-print(2).

A complex function can have nested error handlers.  A  waser‐
ror  block will follow the acquisition of a resource, releas‐
ing it on error before calling nexterror, and a poperror will
precede its release in the normal case.  For example:

       void
       outer(Thing *t)
       {
           qlock(t);
           if(waserror()){      /* A */
               qunlock(t);
               nexterror();
           }
           m = mallocz(READSTR, 0);
           if(m == nil)
               error(Enomem);
           if(waserror()){     /* B */
               free(m);
               nexterror();    /* invokes A */
           }
           inner(t);
           poperror();         /* pops B */
           free(m);
           poperror();         /* pops A */
           qunlock(t);
       }

       void
       inner(Thing *t)
       {
           if(t->bad)
               error(Egreg);   /* error() call returns to B */
           t->valid++;
       }
