AR(10.6)                                                    AR(10.6)

NAME
       ar - archive (library) file format

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ar.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The  archive  command  iar(10.1)  is  used to combine several
       files into one.  Archives are used mainly as libraries to  be
       searched by the loaders 2l(10.1) et al.

       A  file  produced by ar has a magic string at the start, fol‐
       lowed by the constituent  files,  each  preceded  by  a  file
       header.   The  magic number and header layout as described in
       the include file are:

              #define ARMAG   "!<arch>\en"
              #define SARMAG  8

              #define ARFMAG  "`\en"

              struct ar_hdr {
                  char    name[16];
                  char    date[12];
                  char    uid[6];
                  char    gid[6];
                  char    mode[8];
                  char    size[10];
                  char    fmag[2];
              };
              #define SAR_HDR 60

       The name is a blank-padded string.   The  field  contains  to
       help  verify  the presence of a header.  The other fields are
       left-adjusted, blank-padded numbers.  They are decimal except
       for which is octal.  The date is the modification date of the
       file (see sys-stat(2)) at the time of its insertion into  the
       archive.   The  mode is the low 9 bits of the file permission
       mode.  The length of the header is Because the  structure  is
       padded  in  an  architecture-dependent  manner, the structure
       should never be read or written  as  a  unit;  instead,  each
       field should be read or written independently.

       Each  file begins on an even (0 mod 2) boundary; a newline is
       inserted  between  files  if  necessary.   Nevertheless  size
       reflects the actual size of the file exclusive of padding.

       When  all  members of an archive are object files of the same
       architecture, ar automatically  adds  an  extra  file,  named
       __.SYMDEF,  as  the  first  member of the archive.  This file
       contains an index used by the loaders to  locate  all  exter‐
       nally defined text and data symbols in the archive.

       There is no provision for empty areas in an archive file.

BUGS
       The  uid and gid fields are unused.  They provide compatibil‐
       ity with Unix ar format.
