= 0c, 1c, 2c, 5c, 6c, 7c, 8c, kc, qc, vc: C compilers

    2c [ option ...  ] [ file ...  ]
    etc.

These  commands  compile  the named C files into object files
for the corresponding  architecture.   Associated  with  each
compiler is a string objtype, for example

0c spim        Little-endian MIPS

1c 68000       Motorola MC68000

2c 68020       Motorola MC68020

5c arm         ARM 7500

6c amd64       AMD64 extension to x86

7c alpha       Digital Alpha APX

8c 386         Intel i386, i486, Pentium, etc.

kc sparc       Sun SPARC

qc power       Power PC,

vc mips        big-endian MIPS 3000 family

Let  the  first letter of the compiler name be O= 0, 1, 2, 5,
6, 7, 8, k, q, or v.  The output object files end in .O.  The
letter  is  also  the  prefix  of related programs: Oa is the
assembler, Ol is the loader.

Plan 9 conventionally sets the $objtype environment  variable
to  the  objtype  string appropriate to the current machine's
type.  Plan 9 also conventionally has  /objtype  directories,
which contain among other things: include, for machine-depen‐
dent include files; lib, for public  object  code  libraries;
bin,  for  public  programs;  and mkfile, for preconditioning
mk(10.1).

For Inferno cross-compilation on all platforms, not just Plan
9,  both $objtype and $OBJTYPE are set by every native kernel
mkfile to correspond  to  the  target  processor  type.   The
Inferno  mkfiles  also  set  the  -I  option appropriately to
search the Inferno include  directories,  since  the  Plan  9
defaults are inappropriate.

The compiler options are:

-o obj    Place  output in file obj (allowed only if there is
          just one input file).  Default is to take the  last
          element  of the input file name, strip any trailing
          .c, and append .O.

-w        Print warning messages about unused variables, etc.

-B        Accept functions without a new-style ANSI  C  func‐
          tion  prototype.   By default, the compilers reject
          functions  used  without   a   defined   prototype,
          although ANSI C permits them.

-Dname=def
-Dname    Define the name to the preprocessor, as if by If no
          definition is given, the name is defined as

-F        Warn when the elements of a format (eg, those  used
          by  print)  disagree  with in type or size with the
          corresponding parameter, or there is a mismatch  in
          number.  See the discussion of extensions, below.

-Idir     An  file whose name does not begin with slash or is
          enclosed in double quotes is always sought first in
          the directory of the file argument.  If this fails,
          the -.  flag is given or the name  is  enclosed  in
          <>,  it  is  then sought in directories named in -I
          options,  then  in  /sys/include,  and  finally  in
          /$objtype/include.

-.        Suppress  the automatic searching for include files
          in the directory of the file argument.

-N        Suppress automatic  registerization  and  optimiza‐
          tion.

-S        Print  an  assembly  language version of the object
          code on standard output as well as  generating  the
          .O file.

-T        Pass  type  signatures  on  all external and global
          entities.  The signature is based on the  C  signof
          operator,  an  extension  in  this  compiler.   See
          dynld(10.2).

-V        By default, the compilers  are  non-standardly  lax
          about  type equality between void* values and other
          pointers; this flag requires ANSI C conformance.

-a        Instead of compiling, print on standard output acid
          functions (see acid(10.1)) for examining structures
          declared in the source files.

-aa       Like -a except suppress  information  about  struc‐
          tures declared in included header files.

The  compilers  handle  most  preprocessing  directives them‐
selves, but support excludes the #if  and  #elif  directives,
and the ## preprocessor operation.

The compilers support several extensions to ANSI C:

-      A structure or union may contain unnamed substructures
       and subunions.  The fields  of  the  substructures  or
       subunions  can then be used as if they were members of
       the parent structure or union  (the  resolution  of  a
       name  conflict is unspecified).  When a pointer to the
       outer structure or union is used in a context that  is
       only  legal for the unnamed substructure, the compiler
       promotes the type and adjusts  the  pointer  value  to
       point  at  the substructure.  If the unnamed structure
       or union is of a type with a tag name specified  by  a
       typedef  statement, the unnamed structure or union can
       be explicitly referenced  by  <struct  variable>.<tag‐
       name>.

-      A  structure  value  can  be formed with an expression
       such as
           (struct S){v1, v2, v3}
       where the list elements are values for the  fields  of
       struct S.

-      Array  initializers  can  specify  the  indices of the
       array in square brackets, as
           int a[] = { [3] 1, [10] 5 };
       which initializes the third and tenth elements of  the
       eleven-element array a.

-      Structure  initializers can specify the structure ele‐
       ment by using the name following a period, as
           struct { int x; int y; } s = { .y 1, .x 5 };
       which initializes elements y and then x of the  struc‐
       ture  s.  These forms also accept the new ANSI C nota‐
       tion, which includes an equal sign:
           int a[] = { [3] = 1, [10] = 5 };
           struct { int x; int y; } s = { .y = 1, .x = 5 };

-      A global variable can be dedicated to  a  register  by
       declaring  it  extern  register  in  all  modules  and
       libraries.

-      A #pragma of the form
           #pragma lib "libbio.a"
       records that the program needs to be loaded with  file
       /$objtype/lib/libbio.a;  such  lines, typically placed
       in library header files, obviate the -l option of  the
       loaders.   To  help  identify  files  in  non-standard
       directories, within the file names in the #pragmas the
       string  $M  represents  the  name  of the architecture
       (e.g., mips) and $O represents its identifying charac‐
       ter (e.g., v).

-      Two  #pragma  requests  to  define  rules for checking
       print-like formats (see the  -F  option  above).   One
       #pragma  tells  for  a given routine which argument is
       the format.  For example:
           #pragma varargck argpos print 1
           #pragma varargck argpos sprint 2
       say that print has a format as its first argument, and
       sprint  has  one as its second.  Another #pragma asso‐
       ciates format character sequences and types:
          #pragma varargck type "lld" vlong
          #pragma varargck type "lx" void*
          #pragma varargck type "S" Rune*
       where the format characters are those following the  %
       in  the  format  (ignoring  any  preceding  formatting
       flags).  Note the assumption that  all  formats  argu‐
       ments  are  compatible.  The system include files have
       appropriate #pragma lines for the standard format ele‐
       ments and formatting functions.

-      A #pragma of the form
           #pragma incomplete type
       tells the compiler that type should have its signature
       calculated as an incomplete type even when it is fully
       defined.   This allows the type signature mechanism to
       work in the  presence  of  opaque  types  declared  in
       header files, with their full definitions visible only
       to  the  code  which  manipulates  them.   With   some
       imported  software  it  might be necessary to turn off
       the signature generation completely for a  large  body
       of  code (typically at the start and end of a particu‐
       lar include file).  If type is the word _off_,  signa‐
       ture  generation  is  turned  off; if type is the word
       _on_, the compiler will generate signatures.

-      The C++ comment (// to end of  line)  is  accepted  as
       well as the normal convention of /* */.

-      The  compilers  accept long long variables as a 64-bit
       type.  The standard header  typedefs  this  to  vlong.
       Arithmetic  on  vlong  values is usually emulated by a
       run-time library.
