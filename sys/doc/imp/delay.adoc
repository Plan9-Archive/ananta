= delay, microdelay, addclock0link: small delays, clock interrupts

    void delay(int n)

    void microdelay(int n)

    void addclock0link(void(*clockf)(void))

Delay busy waits for n milliseconds, forced to  be  at  least
one millisecond.

Microdelay is similar, but busy waits for n microseconds.

For   delays  on  the  order  of  clock  ticks,  tsleep  (see
sleep(10.2)) provides a better alternative to the busy  wait‐
ing of these routines.

Addclock0link  adds  clockf to a list of functions to be exe‐
cuted at each clock interrupt.
