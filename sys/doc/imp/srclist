= srclist: list source files used to build an executable

    srclist [ -ce ] [ -r rootdir ...  ] executable

Srclist prints on standard output, one per line, the names of
source files used to build the given executable, which should
be in a.out(10.6) format.

By  default, all source file names are listed.  The -c option
restricts the output to names ending  `.c'.   The  -e  option
restricts  the  output  to  file  names that currently exist.
Each -r option adds a new root directory rootdir to an inter‚Äê
nal  list.   Only the names of source files that appear below
one of the root directories will be printed.
