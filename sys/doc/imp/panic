PANIC(10.2)                                              PANIC(10.2)

NAME
       panic - abandon hope

SYNOPSIS
       void  panic(char *fmt, ...)

DESCRIPTION
       Panic  writes  a message to the console and causes the system
       to give up the ghost.  It enables interrupts, dumps the  ker‐
       nel stack, and halts the current processor; if more than one,
       others will gradually come to a halt.  Depending on  configu‐
       ration settings, the platform-dependent exit might reboot the
       system.  The format fmt and associated arguments are the same
       as those for print(10.2).  Panic adds a prefix and a trailing
       newline.

                                                         PANIC(10.2)
