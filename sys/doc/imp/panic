= panic: abandon hope

    void  panic(char *fmt, ...)

Panic  writes  a message to the console and causes the system
to give up the ghost.  It enables interrupts, dumps the  ker‐
nel stack, and halts the current processor; if more than one,
others will gradually come to a halt.  Depending on  configu‐
ration settings, the platform-dependent exit might reboot the
system.  The format fmt and associated arguments are the same
as those for print(10.2).  Panic adds a prefix and a trailing
newline.
