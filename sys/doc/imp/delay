DELAY(10.2)                                              DELAY(10.2)

NAME
       delay, microdelay, addclock0link - small delays, clock inter‐
       rupts

SYNOPSIS
       void delay(int n)

       void microdelay(int n)

       void addclock0link(void(*clockf)(void))

DESCRIPTION
       Delay busy waits for n milliseconds, forced to  be  at  least
       one millisecond.

       Microdelay is similar, but busy waits for n microseconds.

       For   delays  on  the  order  of  clock  ticks,  tsleep  (see
       sleep(10.2)) provides a better alternative to the busy  wait‐
       ing of these routines.

       Addclock0link  adds  clockf to a list of functions to be exe‐
       cuted at each clock interrupt.

SEE ALSO
