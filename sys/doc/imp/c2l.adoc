= c2l: C to Limbo translator

    c2l [ option ...  ] file

C2l  translates  the  named C file into Limbo. The translated
code should be almost always syntactically correct  but  will
certainly never be semantically correct as certain constructs
in C (strings for example) are almost impossible  to  convert
automatically  into  Limbo.   Otherwise it tries to do a good
job of translating the C constructs that have  some  sort  of
equivalence  in  Limbo. The C ternary ?: operator is replaced
where possible.  C library calls are mapped to calls  to  the
Limbo  system module, maths module or the provided Limbo libc
modules. Some library calls,  such  as  malloc,  are  instead
mapped directly into Limbo wherever possible.

Once  a  translation has been made, running the limbo(1) com‐
piler on the resulting output should pick out the areas where
hand editing is required.

C2l  normally puts all mapped C code (plus that from included
files) into a single .b file.

The options to c2l are:

-p     Use an ANSI preprocessor in place of the internal one.

-Dname=def
-Dname Define the name to the preprocessor, as if  by  If  no
       definition is given, the name is defined as

-Idir  An  file  whose  name  does not begin with slash or is
       enclosed in double quotes is always  sought  first  in
       the directory of the file argument.  If this fails, or
       the name is enclosed in  <>,  it  is  then  sought  in
       directories named in -I options, then in /sys/include,
       and finally in /$objtype/include.

-m     Put the mapped code of any included .h files into  its
       corresponding .m file instead of the .b file.

-i     Send  the  mapped  code  of  any  included .h files to
       /dev/null.

-l     Send the mapped code  of  any  non-local  included  .h
       files to /dev/null.

-c     Just  generate  code  corresponding  to  the C code ie
       don't include any prologue or epilogue code such as an
       implement  header, include declarations, module decla‐
       rations or an init function.

-v     Outputs any warnings to  standard  error  as  well  as
       putting them in the output source.

-s     Map  C  strings  to  NUL-terminated arrays of bytes in
       Limbo. This just  about  preserves  the  semantics  of
       strings  and  makes  the  process of hand editing much
       easier. It is useful as a first  attempt  at  transla‐
       tion.  In this case the module /module/libc0.m is used
       in place of the standard one /module/libc.m.

-S     Map char* in C to string in Limbo.  Incompatible  with
       the -s option.

-M     Indicates  this  file is the one containing the C main
       program. Used with the -q option below when  c2l  does
       not always know this until it's too late.

-q     This  reduces the number of passes that c2l makes over
       the C code. It makes it faster but more liable to miss
       some transformations. Cyclic data structures might not
       be detected.

-a     For functions which are passed the address of a scalar
       typed  (ie  not  a structure or union) expression as a
       parameter, pass the expression itself and rewrite  the
       function and all calls of it to return the expression.
       For example :-

          int
          f(int x, int *y)
          {
               *y = x*x*x;
               return x*(*y);
          }

          void
          g()
          {
               int p3, p4;

               p4 = f(1729, &p3);
          }

          becomes

          f(x: int, y: int): (int, int)
          {
               y = x*x*x;
               return (x*y, y);
          }

          g()
          {
               p3, p4: int;

               (p4, p3) = f(1729, p3);
          }

C2l runs the preprocessor  on  the  C  code  before  starting
translation. As a special case it will convert definitions of
constants into Limbo  constant  declarations.   It  makes  no
attempt  to  convert  any  definitions into function declara‐
tions.

Identifier names that clash with Limbo keywords have letter x
appended  so,  for  example,  a  structure member called type
would become typex.

Warning  messages  preceded  by  the  acronym  TBA   (to   be
addressed)  are  issued  for  NUL bytes in strings, ... as an
argument, array indices in declarations, use  of  void  type,
use  of unions, bit fields, use of address operator, negative
array indices, element specifiers, initial  values  in  Limbo
modules, labels, gotos and case statement fall through.

The  C  types  char and unsigned char are mapped to the Limbo
byte type.  The C types short, unsigned short, int,  unsigned
int, long and unsigned long are mapped to the Limbo int type.
The C types long long and unsigned long long  are  mapped  to
the  Limbo big type. Finally the C types float and double are
mapped to the Limbo real type.

Anonymous C structures and unions map to a name of  the  form
<module>_adt_<num>  where  module  is  the name of the module
which is, in turn, derived from the file name. Anonymous mem‐
ber  names  in  strucures  and unions have a name of the form
anon_<num>. Finally,temporary variables generated by c2l have
a  name of the form tmp_<num>. In all cases <num> is a unique
identifier.

== bugs
C2l is not a pretty printer. It has its own idea of how Limbo
should be laid out.

C2l may well crash if given invalid C code.

c2l -a does not always do all possible conversions.
