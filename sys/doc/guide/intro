= introduction

`inf` is unlike anything you've ever used. However, it remains a simple
and elegant system determined to be understood by all. All in a day's
reading, you'll understand more about this system than you may ever know
about your current one.

The system makes a few (as of yet) uncommon choices to provide a beautiful
and clean machine:

 - base-twelve numbering system
 - there are no timezones
 - dozenal clock
 - ido language

== unix differences

The system notes several differences from many standard unix-based facilities;
some of the major ones follow.

 - return signals are strings: an empty string indicates success and a non-empty one contains a failure message
 - utilities are more strictly single purpose (e.g., without a thousand options, arguments, or flags)
 - strings are not NUL terminated (in fact, the NUL character is invalid in a string)
 - no superuser account

== windows differences
