EXPORT(4)             Kernel Interfaces Manual             EXPORT(4)

NAME
       export - export name space on a connection

SYNOPSIS
       export [ -a ] dir [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Export  calls sys-export(2) to serve the name space rooted at
       dir over a connection to a 9P (Styx)  client.   Export  opens
       the  connection on the given file, or uses the standard input
       by default.  It returns when the client  closes  the  connec‚Äê
       tion.   If  the -a option is given, however, export starts an
       Inferno kernel process to serve the name  space  and  returns
       immediately.   Export  serves  the current name space without
       forking it; changes made to it will be visible to clients.

       Export starts serving 9P immediately;  it  assumes  that  the
       connection  has  been  authenticated  if required.  Export is
       typically called via listen(1), which  can  authenticate  the
       connection.

EXAMPLE
       Start  a  background  process  to serve the name space on the
       serial port.

              export / /dev/eia0 &

       Although useful when bootstrapping a system, this  is  unsafe
       unless a transport protocol is run on the connection.
