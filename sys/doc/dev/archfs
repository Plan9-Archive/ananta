= archfs: mount a mkfs archive

    archfs [ -ab ] [ -s ] [ -m mountpoint ] archfile [ prefix ... ]

Archfs mounts at mountpoint (default: /mnt/arch), a read-only
file system representing the contents of archfile, which is a
file of the format produced by mkfs(8) with  the  -a  option.
Typically  the archive file will have been created by mkfs(8)
or create(8).  Any prefix names limit the file system's  con‚Äê
tents  to  files  and  directories  in the archive whose path
names start with one of the prefixes.

The -a and -b  options  cause  the  archive  contents  to  be
mounted  after or before the mount point's existing contents,
in a union dirctory (see bind(1) for details).  Normally  the
archive  contents replace the contents of mountpoint.  The -s
option causes the rest of the archive to be  skipped  once  a
file is found in the archive which does not start with any of
the given prefixes. This is useful an  archive  is  known  to
start  with  a  description  of  its  contents (eg, the /wrap
directory provided by create(8)), and that  is  all  that  is
needed under mountpoint.
