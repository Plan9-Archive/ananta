= trfs: translate  spaces and other runes in names in a file system

    trfs olddir mountdir

Trfs makes the contents of directory  olddir  appear  on  the
directory  mountdir,  but  every  space character in file and
directory names viewed through mountdir is made visible as  a
special  `no-break  space' character (U+00A0).  Other Inferno
applications will not mistake it for the end of a file  name,
and it has some visible representation in most fonts.


== bugs

There  can  be  error  or ambiguity if the existing tree also
uses no-break space in its names.
