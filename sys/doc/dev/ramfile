NAME
       ramfile - synthesise file

SYNOPSIS
       ramfile file [ data ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ramfile  puts  a  virtual file in the name space at file, and
       services file requests on it.  Data written to  the  file  is
       stored  in  ramfile's memory; read requests return the previ‐
       ously stored data.  If the optional  data  argument  is  pro‐
       vided, the file will initially contain that text.  The parent
       directory of file must exist; ramfile creates a  union  mount
       on  that  directory, and if file previously existed, the syn‐
       thesised file will hide it.

       Ramfile uses sys-file2chan(2), which  simplifies  implementa‐
       tion  but  prevents  it  from  knowing when the file has been
       truncated.  Instead, it truncates the file on  any  write  to
       the  start  of the file (offset 0), allowing cp(1) to copy in
       new contents, and text editors to edit it.  Indeed, the  file
       will be usable by all applications that do not rely on updat‐
       ing parts of the file in place, or if they do, do not  update
       the start of the file.

BUGS
       Ramfile  cannot  tell  when  the path has been unmounted; the
       only option is to kill(1) it.
       The file always appears to have zero length  to  sys-stat(2),
       which prevents loading a Dis file from it.
