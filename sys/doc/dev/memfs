MEMFS(4)              Kernel Interfaces Manual              MEMFS(4)

NAME
       memfs - mount a heap based filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       memfs [-s] [-rab] [-m size] [mountpoint]

DESCRIPTION
       Memfs  mounts  a  newly  created heap-based filesystem on the
       given mountpoint directory (default /tmp).

       The filesystem is entirely maintained in memory, no  external
       storage  is used.  File data is allocated in 512 byte blocks.
       If a maximum size is specified, the actual maximum is rounded
       down to the nearest whole number of blocks:

              actualsize := (size / 512) * 512;

       The  root  of the filesystem is owned by the user who invoked
       memfs and is created with Read, Write and Execute permissions
       for  the  owner and Read and Execute permissions for everyone
       else (8r755).

OPTIONS
       -s     Serve styx on file descriptor 0.  The  mountpoint  and
              other mount options are ignored.

       -r     The  default  option.   The  old  mountpoint directory
              becomes a union directory consisting of just the  root
              of the new filesystem.

       -a     Add  the  root of the new filesystem to the end of the
              union directory represented by the  mountpoint  direc‚Äê
              tory.

       -b     Add the root of the new filesystem to the beginning of
              the union  directory  represented  by  the  mountpoint
              directory.
