= 9srvfs: add Inferno service to Plan 9 service registry

    9srvfs [ -p perm ] srvname source

9srvfs  is  only  usable  (or  indeed of interest) on Inferno
hosted under Plan 9.  It uses srv9(3) to make an Inferno ser‐
vice  source  available to Plan 9 applications via the Plan 9
service registry.  Srv9 (3) must previously have  been  bound
to /srv in the current name space, with -c to allow file cre‐
ation (see bind(1)).

Source may be either a command or the name  of  a  directory.
If source is surrounded by braces ({ and }), it is invoked as
a sh(1) command, and its standard input (sic)  is  posted  as
Plan  9  service /srv/srvname with permissions perm (default:
mode 600).  Otherwise, source is taken to be a directory that
is the root of a name space to export to Plan 9, an exporting
file service is started (see sys-export(2)), and again posted
as  Plan  9  service  /srv/srvname, and the export terminates
when the Plan 9 service file has been removed  and  the  last
mounted instance goes away in Plan 9.


== example

Make  the  current Inferno environment variables available to
Plan 9 applications:

    bind -c '#₪' /srv   # if not already done
    9srvfs infenv /env

The name space can then be mounted in Plan 9, allowing  vari‐
ables to be read and written in that Inferno environment:

    mount -c /srv/infenv /n/ftp
    ls /n/ftp
    cat /n/ftp/emuargs
    echo masked man >/n/ftp/zorro
