= mntgen: dynamically generate mount points

    mount {mntgen} dir

Mntgen  serves  9P  on  its  standard input, providing a name
space containing a single directory that is initially  empty,
but in which a subdirectory name appears when is first refer‐
enced, and remains only as long as it is needed (referenced).
Mntgen  is  typically  mounted on a directory dir using mount
(see bind(1)) as above.  Dir is commonly /n or /mnt, to  gen‐
erate mount points on demand for file systems or services.
