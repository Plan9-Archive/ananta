= logfile: memory-based append-only circular storage buffer

    logfile [-size] file

Logfile creates a name at file (the containing directory must
already exist).  Each write to file appends the written  data
up  to  a  maximum of size bytes; subsequent writes erase the
existing data in a circular fashion. A read  from  file  will
return  any  currently stored data, if any; if there is none,
then it will block until more data becomes available.  Multi‚Äê
ple  readers  will  receive  the  data  independently  of one
another. If a writing process is consistently producing  data
faster  than  a reading process, then the data read will have
some bytes elided; a write is never blocked.

== bugs

Restrictions  on  sys-file2chan(2)  mean  that  the   logfile
process  will  not  terminate  automatically when its file is
removed or unmounted.

There is no indication to a reader of any missing data.

It is not possible to do a non-blocking read of the log file.
