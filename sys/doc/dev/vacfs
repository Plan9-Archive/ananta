= vacfs: mount venti archive

    vacfs [ -Ddp ] [ -a addr ] [vac:score]

Vacfs  makes  the  contents of a venti archive available over
styx.  Standard input is used for reading  and  writing  styx
messages.   If  score is not specified, vacfs serves multiple
venti archives.  In this case the  root  directory  lists  no
files,  but  walking to a directory score opens the venti ar‚Äê
chive with that score.  Note that the vacfs does not  support
writing.

-D::     Print styx trace messages.

-d::     Print debug messages.

-p::     Disable permission checking.

-a address::
       Dial address instead of the default venti server.
