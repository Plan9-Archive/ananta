= export: export name space on a connection

    export [ -a ] dir [ file ]

Export  calls sys-export(2) to serve the name space rooted at
dir over a connection to a 9P (Styx)  client.   Export  opens
the  connection on the given file, or uses the standard input
by default.  It returns when the client  closes  the  connec‚Äê
tion.   If  the -a option is given, however, export starts an
Inferno kernel process to serve the name  space  and  returns
immediately.   Export  serves  the current name space without
forking it; changes made to it will be visible to clients.

Export starts serving 9P immediately;  it  assumes  that  the
connection  has  been  authenticated  if required.  Export is
typically called via listen(1), which  can  authenticate  the
connection.


== example

Start  a  background  process  to serve the name space on the
serial port.

    export / /dev/eia0 &

Although useful when bootstrapping a system, this  is  unsafe
unless a transport protocol is run on the connection.
