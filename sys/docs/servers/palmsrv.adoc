= palmsrv: packet link to Palm device on serial connection

    palm/palmsrv [ -D ] [ -d device ] [ -s speed ]

Palmsrv  serves packet link connections to a Palm device con‐
nected on the given device (default: /dev/eia0) at the  given
speed   (default:  57600  baud).   Client  applications  open
/chan/palmsrv to obtain a connection.  Each write  must  con‐
tain the data portion of a single Packet Assembly-Disassembly
Protocol message containing a Desklink protocol request.   If
the  device rejects the request, the write returns a diagnos‐
tic; otherwise, a subsequent read will retrieve the reply.

The server can be shut down by writing the text exit  to  the
file /chan/palmsrv:

       echo -n exit >/chan/palmsrv
