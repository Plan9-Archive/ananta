The  mpeg  device  serves two files giving access to a Boffin
MPEG-1 decoder.

The control file mpegctl when read returns lines of text giv‐
ing the device's properties.  Each line starts video or audio
followed by a  list  of  capabilities.   The  current  device
returns a fixed set:

       video mpeg1,sif
       audio musicam,I musicam,II

The control file accepts the following commands:

init   Reinitialise  the device's video and audio subsystems;
       cancel the effect of stop or pause

stop   Stop the display immediately.

pause  Suspend display.

video iso11172 mpeg1,sif
       Set the output video mode and formats; only this  pre‐
       cise setting is valid.

audio format rate
       There  are  two  choices  for  format: musicam,I (MPEG
       audio layer 1), with rate from 64000 to 448000 Hz, and
       musicam,II  (MPEG  audio layer 2) with rate from 48000
       to 384000.

window minx miny maxx maxy
       Sets the overlay window on the screen, in screen coor‐
       dinates.   If  the  window  size  exceeds 320x240, the
       image is scaled accordingly, separately in each dimen‐
       sion.

The  data  file  mpeg  is  an exclusive-use device.  Once the
device has been initialised and an output  window  set  using
the  init  and  window  commands  to the control file, and an
audio format selected by the audio command, MPEG data can  be
written in the agreed format to the mpeg file, for display in
the output window.  The driver buffers the data  written  and
implements flow control between application and the hardware.
When closed, the device waits for the last block of  data  to
display before returning to the application.
