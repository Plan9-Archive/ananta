= snarf: host window system clipboard

    bind -a #^ /dev
    bind -b #^ /chan

    /dev/snarf
    /chan/snarf

Snarf  serves a single file, snarf.  Reading the file returns
the current contents of the host window  system's  own  clip‐
board  (equivalent to the Inferno window system's `snarf buf‐
fer').  If the file is opened for writing, subsequent  writes
append  to  an internal buffer; when the file is closed, that
buffer's contents are written to  the  host  window  system's
clipboard.

Emu(1)  automatically binds the device to both /dev and /chan
when it starts up, if a window system is configured.
