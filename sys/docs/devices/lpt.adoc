The  lpt  driver provides an interface to the parallel inter‐
face normally used for printers.  The specifiers 1, 2, and  3
correspond  to  the  parallel  interfaces  at PC ports 0x378,
0x3bc, and 0x278 respectively.

Lpt?data is write only.  Writing to  it  sends  data  to  the
interface.   This  file  is sufficient for communicating with
most printers.

Lpt?dlr, lpt?pcr, and lpt?psr are used for  fine  control  of
the  parallel  port.   Reading  or writing these files corre‐
sponds to  reading  and  writing  the  data  latch  register,
printer control register, and printer status register.  These
are used by programs to drive special devices.  The  data  is
written  as  a hexadecimal (leading 0x), octal (leading 0) or
decimal number.  Reads return a hexadecimal number represent‐
ing the value of the register.
