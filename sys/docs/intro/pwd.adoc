= pwd: print working directory


pwd


_Pwd_ prints the path name of the working (current) directory. It is
guaranteed to return the same path that was used to enter the directory.
Note that if meanwhile the name space has changed, or directories in the
path have been renamed, the path name may no longer be valid.
