= mv: move files


*mv* _fromfile_ _tofile_ +
*mv* _fromfile ..._ _todir_


_Mv_ moves _fromfile_ to _tofile_. If the files are in the same
directory, _fromfile_ is simply renamed; a previously existing file
named _tofile_ will be (silently) removed. Otherwise, _mv_ copies
_fromfile_ to _tofile_, then removes _fromfile_. This requires write
permission for the parent directories involved.

If the last argument is a directory, the earlier arguments (all files)
will be moved into that directory. Any previously existing files of the
same name will be overwritten. Directories can only be renamed: _mv_
refuses to move one into another.
