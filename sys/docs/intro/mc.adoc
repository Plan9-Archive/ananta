= mc: multicolumn print


*mc* [ **-c**__ columns__ ] [ _file ..._ ]


_Mc_ formats the contents of _files_ (standard input by default) into
columns. _Columns_ is an integer specifying the number of character
widths into which _mc_'s output is formatted. If run in an _acme_(1)
window, the default _columns_ is the number of zeros that will fit
across the window; otherwise the default _columns_ is 65.
