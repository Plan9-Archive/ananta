= 9win: create a Plan 9 window within Inferno

[source,subs=quotes]
*9win* [ -s ] [ *-x width* ] [ *-y height* ] [ _cmd_ [ _arg ..._ ] ]

_9win_ creates a window for a graphical Plan 9 command (default *rio*)
to run in. If provided, _width_ and _height_ give a desired width and
height for the new window. _Cmd_ gives the command to run, and _arg_ its
arguments.

The *-s* option tells _9win_ to run in server mode. Used by _9cpu_(1),
it exports on its standard input a namespace suitable for a graphical
Plan 9 program to run within. With this option, no command may be given.

== BUGS

_9win_ does not export a full _rio_ environment, so Plan 9 programs that
wish to create new windows will not work correctly (unless running
inside a _rio_ started by _9win_)
