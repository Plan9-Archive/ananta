= telnet: make a remote telnet connection


*telnet* _machine_


*Telnet* uses the Telnet protocol to talk to a remote _machine_,
addressed using any form acceptable to _dial_(2):
__net__**!**__host__**!**_port_ in general. The default _net_ is *tcp*,
and the default _port_ is 23, the standard Telnet login port.

_Telnet_ connects to the given _machine_ and interprets the Telnet
protocol. It reads data from its standard input and sends it to the
remote machine, and copies to the standard output the data it receives
from the remote machine.
