= time: time command execution


*time* _command_ [ _arg ..._ ]


_Time_ executes the _command_ with the given arguments, and reports on
standard error the command's load time, real time for execution, and the
total, in seconds. The load time is just the time for _time_ itself to
load _command_; loads done later by the command are included in the real
time. To time a pipeline, use the *-c* option to _sh_(1):

*time sh -c 'ps | grep Sh'*
