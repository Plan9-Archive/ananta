= sendmail: send mail messages


*sendmail* [ _recipient ..._ ]


*Sendmail* sends mail to each _recipient_ named as an argument. It reads
its standard input to get the text of the message. If no _recipient_ is
named, the recipient(s) will be taken from the message header.

The mail message is scanned for lines beginning

and

 +
If no `from' line is found, the sender is assumed to be the current
user. The recipient(s) of the message can be mentioned as arguments or
in a list of names in a

line but not as both. If the sender's name is unqualified (is just a
user name), _sendmail_ appends the value of the environment variable

*Sendmail* delivers the mail using the module _smtp_(2), which connects
to a mail server running the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP),
using the symbolic host name *$MAILSERVER* (see _db_(6)).
