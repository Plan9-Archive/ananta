= rm: remove file(s)


*rm* [ *-fr* ] _file ..._


_Rm_ removes the specified files or directories. A directory is removed
only if it is empty (but see the *-r* option). Removal of a file
requires write permission in its directory, but requires neither read
nor write permission on the file itself. The options are:

*-f*::
  Suppress diagnostics
*-r*::
  Recursively remove a directory's substructure before removing the
  directory.
