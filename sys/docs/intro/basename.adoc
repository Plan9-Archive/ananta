= basename: strip file name affixes

[source,subs=quotes]
----
*basename* [ *-d* ] _string_ [ _suffix_ ]
----

_Basename_ deletes any prefix ending in slash (*/*) and the _suffix_, if
present in _string_, from _string_, and prints the result on the
standard output.

The *-d* option instead prints the directory component, that is,
_string_ up to but not including the final slash. If the string contains
no slash, the current directory name

is printed.
