= cat: concatenate files


*cat* [ *-* ] [ _file ..._ ]


_Cat_ reads each _file_ in turn and writes it on the standard output.
Thus

....
cat file
....

prints the file to standard output, and the following

....
cat file1 file2 >file3
....

concatenates two files onto a third.

If no _file_ is given, or where *-* is given as an argument, _cat_ reads
from the standard input. Output is buffered in blocks matching the
input.

== BUGS

Beware of *cat a b >a* and *cat a b >b* which destroy input files before
reading them.
