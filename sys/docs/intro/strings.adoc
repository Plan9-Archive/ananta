= strings: extract printable strings


*strings* [ _file ..._ ]


_Strings_ finds and prints strings containing 6 or more consecutive
printable UTF-encoded characters in a (typically) binary file, default
standard input. Printable characters are taken to be

characters from blank through tilde (hexadecimal 20 through 7E),
inclusive, and all other characters from value 00A0 to FFFF. Strings
reports the decimal offset within the file at which the string starts
and the text of the string. If the string is longer than 70 runes the
line is terminated by three dots and the printing is resumed on the next
line with the offset of the continuation line.
