= keyboard, pen: character input for touch screen devices


*wm/keyboard* [ *-e* ] [ *-t* ] +

*wm/pen* [ *-e* ] [ *-r* ] [ *-t* ]


*Wm/keyboard* provides a soft keyboard for touch-screen devices.
Characters selected on the on-screen keyboard using a stylus (or mouse
button 1) are passed to Tk via *Tk->keyboard* in _tk_(2). The *-t*
option causes it to put itself on the _wm_(1) task bar from the start.
The *-e* option causes it to treat the `exit' button on the title bar as
a request to put itself back on the task bar.

*Wm/pen* provides character input using single-stroke gestures with the
stylus (or mouse button 1). The *-r* option allows the pen window to be
reshaped. Options are otherwise the same as for *wm/keyboard*.
