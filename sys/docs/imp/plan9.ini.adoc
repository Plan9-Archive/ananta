= plan9.ini: configuration file for PCs

    none

When  booting  Inferno on a PC, the Plan 9 bootstrap programs
are used, hence the references to Plan 9 below.  The DOS pro‐
gram 9load(10.8) first reads a DOS file containing configura‐
tion information from the boot disk.  This  file,  plan9.ini,
looks like a shell script containing lines of the form

     name=value

each of which defines a kernel or device parameter.

For devices, the generic format of value is

     type=TYPE [port=N] [irq=N] [mem=N] [size=N] [dma=N] [ea=N]

specifying  the  controller  type,  the  base I/O port of the
interface, its interrupt level, the physical starting address
of any mapped memory, the length in bytes of that memory, the
DMA channel, and for Ethernets an override  of  the  physical
network  address.   Not  all  elements  are  relevant  to all
devices; the relevant values and their defaults  are  defined
below in the description of each device.

The  file  is  used  by 9load and the kernel to configure the
hardware available.  The  information  it  contains  is  also
passed  to the boot process, and subsequently other programs,
as environment variables (see also  osinit.dis  in  root(3)).
However, values whose names begin with an asterisk * are used
by the kernel and are not converted  into  environment  vari‐
ables.

The following sections describe how variables are used.

   etherX=value
This  defines  an  Ethernet interface.  X, a unique monotoni‐
cally increasing number beginning at 0, identifies an  Ether‐
net  card  to be probed at system boot.  Probing stops when a
card is found or there is no line for etherX+1.  After  prob‐
ing  as  directed by the etherX lines, any remaining ethernet
cards that can be automatically detected are  added.   Almost
all  cards can be automatically detected.  For debugging pur‐
poses, automatic probing can be disabled  by  specifying  the
line  *noetherprobe=.  This automatic probing is only done by
the kernel, not by 9load(10.8).  Thus, if you want to load  a
kernel  over the ethernet, you need to specify an ether0 line
so that 9load can find the ethernet card, even if the  kernel
would have automatically detected it.

Some  cards  are software configurable and do not require all
options.   Unspecified  options  default   to   the   factory
defaults.

Known types are

ne2000 Not software configurable. 16-bit card.  Defaults are
            port=0x300 irq=2 mem=0x04000 size=0x4000
       The  option  (no  value)  nodummyrr  is needed on some
       (near) clones to turn off a dummy remote read  in  the
       driver.

amd79c970
       The  AMD PCnet PCI Ethernet Adapter (AM79C970).  (This
       is the ethernet adapter used by  VMware.)   Completely
       configurable, no options need be given.

wd8003 Includes  WD8013  and SMC Elite and Elite Ultra cards.
       There are varying degrees of software configurability.
       Cards   may  be  in  either  8-bit  or  16-bit  slots.
       Defaults are
            port=0x280 irq=3 mem=0xD0000 size=0x2000
       BUG: On many machines only the 16 bit card works.

elnk3  The 3COM Etherlink III series of cards  including  the
       5x9,  59x, and 905 and 905B.  Completely configurable,
       no options need be given.  The media may be  specified
       by  setting  media=  to  the  value  10BaseT, 10Base2,
       100BaseTX, 100BaseFX, aui, and mii.  If  you  need  to
       force  full  duplex,  because for example the Ethernet
       switch does not negotiate  correctly,  just  name  the
       word  (no  value)  fullduplex  or 100BASE-TXFD.  Simi‐
       larly, to force 100Mbit operation,  specify  force100.
       Port  0x110  is  used for the little ISA configuration
       dance.

3c589  The 3COM 3C589  series  PCMCIA  cards,  including  the
       3C562 and the 589E.  There is no support for the modem
       on the 3C562.   Completely  configurable,  no  options
       need be given.  Defaults are
            port=0x240 irq=10
       The   media  may  be  specified  as  media=10BaseT  or
       media=10Base2.

ec2t   The Linksys Combo PCMCIA EthernetCard  (EC2T),  Ether‐
       Fast  10/100  PCMCIA  cards  (PCMPC100) and integrated
       controllers (PCM100), the Netgear FA410TX 10/100  PCM‐
       CIA  card  and  the  Accton EtherPair-PCMCIA (EN2216).
       Completely configurable, no  options  need  be  given.
       Defaults are
            port=0x300 irq=9
       These  cards are NE2000 clones.  Other NE2000 compati‐
       ble PCMCIA cards may be tried with the option
            id=string
       where string is a unique identifier  string  contained
       in  the  attribute memory of the card (see pcmcia(8));
       unlike most options in plan9.ini, this string is case-
       sensitive.   The  option  dummyrr=[01]  can be used to
       turn off (0) or on (1) a  dummy  remote  read  in  the
       driver in such cases, depending on how NE2000 compati‐
       ble they are.

i82557 Cards using the Intel 8255[789] Fast Ethernet PCI  Bus
       LAN   Controller   such   as  the  Intel  EtherExpress
       PRO/100B.  Completely configurable, no options need be
       given.  If you need to force the media, specify one of
       the options (no value) 10BASE-T,  10BASE-2,  10BASE-5,
       100BASE-TX,   10BASE-TFD,   100BASE-TXFD,  100BASE-T4,
       100BASE-FX, or 100BASE-FXFD.

2114x  Cards using the Digital Equipment  (now  Intel)  2114x
       PCI  Fast Ethernet Adapter Controller, for example the
       Netgear FA310.  Completely  configurable,  no  options
       need be given.  Media can be specified the same was as
       for the i82557.  Some cards using the PNIC  and  PNIC2
       near-clone chips may also work.

wavelan
       Lucent  Wavelan  (Orinoco) IEEE 802.11b and compatible
       PCMCIA cards.  Compatible cards include the Dell True‐
       Mobile  1150  and the Linksys Instant Wireless Network
       PC Card.  Port  and  IRQ  defaults  are  0x180  and  3
       respectively.

       These  cards take a number of unique options to aid in
       identifying the card correctly on the 802.11b network.
       The  network  may  be  ad  hoc or managed (i.e. use an
       access point):
            mode=[adhoc, managed]
       and defaults  to  managed.   The  802.11b  network  to
       attach to (managed mode) or identify as (ad hoc mode),
       is specified by
            essid=string
       and defaults to a null string.  The card station  name
       is given by
            station=string
       and  defaults  to  Plan  9 STA.  The channel to use is
       given by
            channel=number
       where number lies in the range 1 to 16 inclusive;  the
       channel is normally negotiated automatically.

       If  the  card  is capable of encryption, the following
       options may be used:
            crypt=[off, on]
       and defaults to on.
            keyN=string
       sets the encryption key n (where n is in the  range  1
       to  4  inclusive)  to  string;  this will also set the
       transmit key to n (see below).
            txkey=number
       sets the transmit key to use to be number in the range
       1  to  4  inclusive.   If  it is desired to exclude or
       include unencrypted packets
            clear=[off, on]
       configures reception and defaults to inclusion.

       The defaults are intended to match the common case  of
       a  managed network with encryption and a typical entry
       would only require, for example
            essid=left-armpit key2=fishcalledraawaru
       if the port and IRQ defaults are used.  These  options
       may  be  set after boot by writing to the device's ctl
       file using a space as the separator between option and
       value, e.g.
            echo 'key2 fishcalledraawaru' > /net/ether0/0/ctl

wavelanpci
       PCI  ethernet  adapters that use the same Wavelan pro‐
       gramming interface.  Currently the only  tested  cards
       are those based on the Intersil Prism 2.5 chipset.

83815  National Semiconductor DP83815-based adapters, notably
       the Netgear FA311,  Netgear  FA312,  and  various  SiS
       built-in  controllers  such as the SiS900.  On the SiS
       controllers, the  ethernet  address  is  not  detected
       properly; specify it with an ea= attribute.

rtl8139
       The Realtek 8139.

82543gc
       The  Intel  RS-82543GC gigabit ethernet controller, as
       found on the Intel PRO/1000[FT] server  adapter.   The
       older  non-[FT] cards based on the 82542 (LSI L2A1157)
       chip are not supported, although support would  proba‐
       bly be easy to add.

smc91cxx
       SMC  91cXX chip-based PCMCIA adapters, notably the SMC
       EtherEZ card.

sink   A /dev/null for ethernet packets — the interface  dis‐
       cards  sent  packets  and never receives any.  This is
       used to provide a test bed for some experimental  eth‐
       ernet bridging software.

   usbX=type=uhci port=xxx irq=xxx
This  specifies the settings for a USB UHCI controller.  Like
the ethernet controllers, USB  controllers  are  autodetected
after  scanning for the ones listed in plan9.ini.  Thus, most
systems will not need a usbX line.  Also  like  the  ethernet
controllers,  USB  autoprobing  can be disabled by specifying
the line *nousbprobe=.

   scsiX=value
This defines a SCSI interface which cannot  be  automatically
detected by the kernel.

Known types are

aha1542
       The  Adaptec  154x series of controllers (and clones).
       Almost completely configurable, only the
            port=0x300
       option need be given.

NCR/Symbios/LSI Logic 53c8xx-based adapters and Mylex  Multi‐
Master  (Buslogic  BT-*)  adapters are automatically detected
and need no entries.

By default, the NCR 53c8xx driver searches for up to 32  con‐
trollers.   This  can  be  changed  by  setting  the variable
*maxsd53c8xx.

By default the Mylex driver resets SCSI cards by  using  both
the  hard reset and SCSI bus reset flags in the driver inter‐
face.  If a variable *noscsireset is defined,  the  SCSI  bus
reset flag is omitted.

   Uarts
Plan  9  automatically configures COM1 and COM2, if found, as
eia0 (port 0x3F8, IRQ4) and eia1 (port 0x2F8,  IRQ3)  respec‐
tively.  These devices can be disabled by adding a line:
    eiaX=disabled
This  is typically done in order to reuse the IRQ for another
device.

The system used  to  support  various  serial  concentrators,
including  the  TTC  8 serial line card and various models in
the Star Gate Avanstar series of intelligent  serial  boards.
These  are  no  longer supported; the much simpler Perle PCI-
Fast4, PCI-Fast8, and PCI-Fast16 controllers have taken their
places.   These  latter  cards are automatically detected and
need no configuration lines.

The line serial=type=com can be used to specify settings  for
a PCMCIA modem.

   mouseport=value
This specifies where the mouse is attached.  Value can be

ps2    the PS2 mouse/keyboard port.  The BIOS setup procedure
       should be used to configure the machine appropriately.

ps2intellimouse
       an Intellimouse on the PS2 port.

0      for COM1

1      for COM2

   modemport=value
Picks the UART line to call out on.  This is used  when  con‐
necting  to  a  file server over an async line.  Value is the
number of the port.

   pccard0=disabled
Disable probing for and automatic configuration  of  PC  card
controllers.

   pcmciaX=type=XXX irq=value
If  the default IRQ for the PCMCIA is correct, this entry can
be omitted.  The value of type is ignored.

   pcmcia0=disabled
Disable probing for and  automatic  configuration  of  PCMCIA
controllers.

   console=value params
This  is  used  to  specify  the console device.  The default
value is cga; a number 0 or 1 specifies COM1 or COM2  respec‐
tively.   A  serial  console is initially configured with the
eia(3) configuration string b9600 l8 pn s1,  specifying  9600
baud, 8 bit bytes, no parity, and one stop bit.  If params is
given, it will be used to further configure the uart.  Notice
that there is no = sign in the params syntax.  For example,
    console=0 b19200 po
would use COM1 at 19,200 baud with odd parity.

   bootfile=value
This  is  used to direct the actions of 9load(10.8) by naming
the device and file from which to load the kernel.

   partition=value
This defines the partition table 9load(10.8) will examine  to
find  disk partitioning information.  By default, a partition
table in a Plan 9 partition is consulted; if no such table is
found,  an  old-Plan 9 partition table on the next-to-last or
last sector of the disk is consulted.  A value  of  new  con‐
sults only the first table, old only the second.

   *maxmem=value
This  defines  the  maximum  physical address that the system
will scan when sizing memory.  By default the operating  sys‐
tem  will  scan up to 768 megabytes, but setting *maxmem will
limit the scan.  If the system has more than  768  megabytes,
you must set *maxmem for the kernel to find it.  *maxmem must
be less than 1.75 gigabytes.

   *kernelpercent=value
This defines what percentage of available memory is  reserved
for  the  kernel  allocation pool.  The remainder is left for
user processes.  The default value is 30 on CPU  servers,  60
on  terminals with less than 16MB of memory, and 40 on termi‐
nals with memories of 16MB or more.  Terminals use more  ker‐
nel  memory  because  draw(3) maintains its graphic images in
kernel memory.  This deprecated option is rarely necessary in
newer kernels.

   *nomce=value
If  machine  check exceptions are supported by the processor,
then they are enabled by default.  Setting this variable to 1
causes them to be disabled even when available.

   *nomp=
A  multiprocessor  machine  will  enable  all  processors  by
default.  Setting *nomp restricts the kernel to starting only
one processor and using the traditional interrupt controller.

   *ncpu=value
Setting  *ncpu restricts the kernel to starting at most value
processors.

   *pcimaxbno=value
This puts a limit on the maximum bus number probed on  a  PCI
bus  (default 255).  For example, a value of 1 should suffice
on a 'standard' motherboard with  an  AGP  slot.   This,  and
*pcimaxdno  below  are rarely used and only on troublesome or
suspect hardware.

   *pcimaxdno=value
This puts a limit on the maximum device number  probed  on  a
PCI bus (default 31).

   *nopcirouting=
Disable pci routing during boot.  May solve interrupt routing
problems on certain machines.

   ioexclude=value
Specifies a list of ranges I/O ports to exclude from  use  by
drivers.   Ranges are inclusive on both ends and separated by
commas.  For example:
    ioexclude=0x330-0x337,0x430-0x43F

   apm0=
This enables the ``advanced power management''  interface  as
described  in  apm(3).   The main feature of the interface is
the ability to watch battery life.  It is not on  by  default
because it causes problems on some laptops.

   monitor=value
   vgasize=value
These  are  used  not by the kernel but by system initialisa‐
tion.

   *dpms=value
This is used to specify the screen blanking behavior  of  the
MGA4xx  video  driver.  Values are standby, suspend, and off.
The first two specify differing levels of power  saving;  the
third turns the monitor off completely.

   nvr=value
This is used by a file server kernel to locate a file holding
information to configure the file system.   The  file  cannot
live  on  a  SCSI disk.  The default is fd!0!plan9.nvr (sic),
unless bootfile is set, in which case it is plan9.nvr on  the
same  disk as bootfile.  The syntax is either fd!unit!name or
hd!unit!name where unit is the numeric unit id.  This variant
syntax is a vestige of the file server kernel's origins.

   audioX=value
This defines a sound interface.

Known types are

sb16   Sound Blaster 16.

ess1688
       A Sound Blaster clone.

The DMA channel may be any of 5, 6, or 7.  The defaults are
     port=0x220 irq=7 dma=5

   fs=a.b.c.d
   auth=a.b.c.d
These  specify  the IP address of the file and authentication
server to use when mounting a network-provided root file sys‐
tem.   They  are  used only if the addresses cannot be deter‐
mined via DHCP.

== multiple Configurations
A plan9.ini file may contain  multiple  configurations,  each
within a block beginning with a line
     [tag]
A special block with the tag menu gives a list of blocks from
which the user  may  interactively  select  the  contents  of
plan9.ini.   There  may  also be multiple blocks with the tag
common which will be included in all selections; if any lines
appear  in plan9.ini before the first block, they are treated
as a common block.

Within the menu block the following configuration  lines  are
allowed:

   menuitem=tag[, description]
The  block  identified  by  tag  will appear in the presented
menu.  The menu entry will consist  of  the  tag  unless  the
optional description is given.

   menudefault=tag[, timeout]
Identifies  a default block to be given in the menu selection
prompt.  If the optional timeout is given (in  seconds),  the
default  block  will  be  selected  if there is no user input
within the timeout period.

   menuconsole=value[, baud]
Selects a serial console upon which to present the menu as no
console or baud configuration information will have been pro‐
cessed  yet  (the  plan9.ini  contents  are   still   to   be
decided...).

In  response  to the menu being printed, the user is prompted
to select a menu item from the list.  If the numeric response
is followed by a p, the selected configuration is printed and
the menu presented again.

The line
     menuitem=tag
is prefixed to the selected configuration as an aid to  user-
level initialization scripts.

== examples
A representative plan9.ini:

       % cat /n/c:/plan9.ini
       ether0=type=3C509

       modemport=1
       serial0=type=generic port=0x3E8 irq=5
       monitor=445x
       vgasize=1600x1200x8
       %

Minimum  CONFIG.SYS  and  AUTOEXEC.BAT files to use COM2 as a
console:

       % cat /n/c:/config.sys
       SHELL=COMMAND.COM COM2 /P
       % cat /n/c:/autoexec.bat
       @ECHO OFF

Simple plan9.ini with multiple configurations:

       [menu]
       menuitem=vga, Plan 9 with VGA
       menuitem=novga, Plan 9 no automatic VGA
       menudefault=vga

       [vga]

       [common]
       ether0=type=i82557
       audio0=type=sb16 port=0x220 irq=5 dma=1

With this, the following menu will be presented on boot:

       Plan 9 Startup Menu:

Selecting item 1 generates the following plan9.ini to be used
by the remainder of the bootstrap process:

       menuitem=vga
       monitor=multisync135
       vgasize=1024x768x8
       ether0=type=i82557

== bugs
Being  able to set the console device to other than a display
is marginally useful on file servers; MS-DOS and the programs
which  run  under it are so tightly bound to the display that
it is necessary to have a display if any setup or  reconfigu‐
ration  programs  need to be run.  Also, the delay before any
messages appear at boot time is disconcerting, as  any  error
messages from the BIOS are lost.

This  idea  is  at  best an interesting experiment that needs
another iteration.
