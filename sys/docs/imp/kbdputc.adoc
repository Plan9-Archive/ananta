= kbdputc,  kbdrepeat,  kbdclock,  kbdq: keyboard interface to cons(3)

    #include "keyboard.h"

    void    kbdputc(Queue *q, int c)

    void    kbdrepeat(int on)

    void    kbdclock(void)

    extern  Queue *kbdq;

This is  the  internal  interface  between  /dev/keyboard  of
cons(3)   and  the  architecture-dependent  keyboard  driver.
Before calling any of these functions,  the  global  variable
kbdq  must  be  initialised;  cons(3) does not initialise it.
This is usually done during system initialisation by the key‐
board driver's kbdinit function , as follows:

       kbdq = qopen(4*1024, 0, 0, 0);
       qnoblock(kbdq, 1);

Kbdputc  puts  a 16-bit Unicode character c (ie, a `rune') on
the given q, as a sequence of bytes in  UTF-8  encoding  (see
utf(6)).   If  c  is the special value Latin (defined by key‐
board.h), kbdputc starts collecting characters,  looking  for
the typeable representations of Unicode characters defined by
keyboard(6); at the end of a complete such sequence,  kbdputc
queues  the UTF-8 encoding of the corresponding Unicode char‐
acter.  It is up to the keyboard driver  to  map  a  suitable
physical keyboard character (or combination of characters) to
the code Latin.

Drivers that need to implement repeat of keypresses in  soft‐
ware should call

       addclock0link(kbdclock);

at  the  end  of kbdinit, to cause kbdclock to be called each
clock tick.  Kbdrepeat can then be called to  enable  (on  is
non-zero)  or  disable  it  (on is zero).  When repeat is on,
kbdclock (when called) will periodically call kbdputc(kbdq,c)
where  c  is  the  last rune given to kbdputc.  The driver is
responsible for enabling and disabling repeat  appropriately;
for  instance, function keys and certainly Latin should typi‐
cally not be repeated.
