The  hash module provides support for arrays that are indexed
by keys of type string.

The values may be any combination of int,  real,  or  string.
New  creates and returns a new HashTable with size slots. The
hashing works best if size is a prime number. The HashVal adt
contains  the data values of the hash.  The HashNode adt con‚Äê
tains the key/value pair for each element in the table.

ht.insert(key, value)
       Adds a new key/value pair to the table.  If an element
       with  the same key already exists, it will acquire the
       new value.

ht.find(key)
       Search the table for an element with the given key and
       return the value found; return nil if none was found.

ht.delete(key)
       Removes any element with the given key from the table.

ht.all()
       Returns  a  list  of all key/value pairs stored in the
       table.

Fun1 and fun2 provide access to two different string  hashing
functions.  Fun1 is the function used internally; fun2 is the
same as that used in the Limbo compiler.  They  each  compute
the hash value of s and return a value between 0 and n-1.

HashVal should really be a pick.
