    remove:   fn(file: string): int;

Remove removes file from the directory containing it and dis‐
cards the contents of the file.  The  user  must  have  write
permission  in the containing directory.  If file is a direc‐
tory, it must be empty.  Remove returns zero  if  it  deletes
the file, -1 otherwise.
